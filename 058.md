# UXDCouncilToken.sol is not cross-chain

## Summary

UXDCouncilToken.sol is not cross-chain

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation, the UXD token is cross-chain and integrated with layerZero.

The UXP governance token is cross-chain and integrated with layerZero.

However, in the begining, the UXDCouncilToken is considered as a transition token towards the UXP token and served as the tempory voting token for on-chain voting.

But the UXDCouncilToken does not integrate with LayerZero and UXDCouncilToken is not cross-chain.

## Impact

The impact can be severe. This means in which network, ethereum mainnet, arbitrum and optimsim, there will be three version of UXDCouncilToken and the distribution of UXDCouncilToken in each network can be distinct, the on-chain governance management can diverge from chain-to-chain.

The lack of consistency in governance proposal and UXDCouncilToken distribution can harm the protocol.

For example,

If Using UXP as the govnerance token, a user who cares about the protocol can acqurie the governance token in any chain and knows that he acquired voting power.

He can buy the UXP in optimism and vote the proposal in arbitrum after bridging the token.

However, he cannot do that using UXDCouncilToken. He can acquire the UXDCouncil in arbitrum and try to increase the soft cap for UXD, he has to do again in optimism, which is double-efforts and unfair for user who wants to vote.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol make the UXDCouncilToken cross-chain.
