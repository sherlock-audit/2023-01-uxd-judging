# `UXDToken.Controller` should not be immutable

## Summary
The `controller` variable of `UXDToken` is immutable, meaning any upgrade to `UXDController` will break minting/redeeming of UXD.

## Vulnerability Detail
`UXDController` is implemented as an upgradeable contract.
The issue is that in `UXDToken`, `controller` is immutable.
If `UXDController` is upgraded, minting and redeeming functions will not work, as the calls to `UXDToken.mint()` and `UXDToken.burn()` will revert because of the `onlyController` modifier (`UXDToken.controller` will be the "old" controller address).

## Impact
`UXDController` cannot be upgraded,
