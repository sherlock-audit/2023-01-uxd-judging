# No fallback depository if depository is paused

## Summary

The `UXDRouter` contract always returns the first depository for a given asset. In case there are multiple depositories for a single asset and the first one is paused, minting UXD or redeeming asset tokens will not work. 

## Vulnerability Detail

When minting UXD or withdrawing asset tokens for UXD, `UXDController` calls the `findDepositoryForDeposit()` or `findDepositoryForRedeem()` functions of `UXDRouter`

Both function return the first depository in the list of depositories for a specific asset but they donâ€™t take into account whether the depository is actually working. 

For example, if the first depository is an instance of `PerpDepository` , which is interacting with a specific perp vault and clearing house, if the perp vault or clearing house is paused, `mint` and `redeem` of `UXDController` will not work anymore, even if there might be another depository able to mint/redeem the UXD or requested asset token.

`deposit()` and `withdraw()` of a perp vault (`Vault.sol`) which is called by `PerpDepository`. Notice the deposit/withdraw will revert if the vault is paused.

```solidity
function deposit(address token, uint256 amount)
    external
    override
    whenNotPaused
    nonReentrant
    onlySettlementOrCollateralToken(token)
{
    // input requirement checks:
    //   token: here
    //   amount: here

    address from = _msgSender();
    _deposit(from, from, token, amount);
}

function withdraw(address token, uint256 amount)
    external
    override
    whenNotPaused
    nonReentrant
    onlySettlementOrCollateralToken(token)
{
    // input requirement checks:
    //   token: here
    //   amount: here

    address to = _msgSender();
    _settleAndDecreaseBalance(to, token, amount);
    SafeERC20Upgradeable.safeTransfer(IERC20Upgradeable(token), to, amount);
    emit Withdrawn(token, to, amount);
}
```

`openPosition()` and of a perp clearing house (`ClearingHouse.sol`) which is called by `PerpDepository`. Notice the function will revert if the vault is paused.

```solidity
function openPosition(OpenPositionParams memory params)
    external
    override
    whenNotPaused
    nonReentrant
    checkDeadline(params.deadline)
    returns (uint256 base, uint256 quote)
{
    // openPosition() is already published, returned types remain the same (without fee)
    (base, quote, ) = _openPositionFor(_msgSender(), params);
    return (base, quote);
}
```

## Impact

Users might not able to interact with the protocol (e.g. mint/redeem UXD/asset tokens) even if there are depositories which might function correctly.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a function in the depositories to check whether they are able to mint/redeem by checking the status of the vault/clearing house they are interacting with (in case of perp). 

Then, `findDepositoryForDeposit()` and `findDepositoryForRedeem()` could use this function to only return depositories which are currently active and not paused.
