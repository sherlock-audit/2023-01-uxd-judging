# Approval in PerpDeposit.sol can be exploited to cause loss of funds

## Summary
When rebalancing the delta-neutral position in `PerpDepository.sol`, the function `rebalance()`/`rebalanceLite()` takes the argument `address account` to debit or credit the shortfall/quote token. There is no check in place to verify the allowances of this account address for msg.sender, meaning anyone can use anyone else's account address and draw the shortfall cost from them as long as the victim approved the depository contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the function `rebalance()` in `PerpDepository.sol`, the caller passes an account address (the victim). 
```solidity
function rebalance(
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 amountOutMinimum,
        uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96,
        uint24 swapPoolFee,
        int8 polarity,
        address account)
```
This account address is then used to transfer out the shortfall tokens, or for transferring quote tokens when using rebalance lite.
**Normal rebalance**:
```solidity
if (shortFall > 0) {
            IERC20(quoteToken).transferFrom(
                account,
                address(this),
                uint256(shortFall)
            );}
```
**Rebalance lite**:
```solidity
        IERC20(quoteToken).transferFrom(account, address(this), amount);
        IERC20(quoteToken).approve(address(vault), amount);
        vault.deposit(quoteToken, amount);
```
However, the contract never checks if the msg.sender is even allowed to handle the finances of this `address account`. If a user (victim) approves the depository contract to handle their USDC (assume infinite approval), then later users (attacker) can use the victim's approval to draw out tokens from the victim's wallet to settle these shortfalls/swaps.
 At times of high volatility, the mark price can differ significantly from the uniswap market price, leading to large shortfall amounts which will be drawn out of the victim's wallet. Since this abuses the allowance system, and lets any user cause loss of funds of another user, this is classified as High severity.
## Impact
Loss of funds from victim address.

## Recommendation
Can be mitigated by one of two ways:
1. Check victim's approval of msg.sender. Msg.sender is only allowed to call rebalance with an amount allowed by the account owner, and have the allowance be deducted after rebalance.
2. Remove `address account` option, and draw funds from the msg.sender themselves
