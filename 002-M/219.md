# Eth sent to contract cannot be withdrawn

## Summary
UXDController.sol has a fallback function which can lockup eth in contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Navigate to contracts/core/UXDController.sol
2. It has a receive() function which is capable of receiving eth sent to contract.
3. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDController.sol#L89
4. But there is no way to withdraw this eth.

## Impact
As there is no way to withdraw eth, eth sent to contract using fallback will lockup and cannot be withdrawn.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    /// @notice Fallback function for this contract to receive ETH
    // solhint-disable-next-line no-empty-blocks
    receive() external payable {}
```
