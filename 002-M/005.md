# UXDController: receive function is dangerous

## Summary
The UXDController implements the receive function but no logic is executed when it is called.
This means any ETH sent to the contract without calling any specific function are lost (similarly when a non-existent function is called).

## Vulnerability Detail
This behavior is dangerous because it can easily happen that a user that actually wants to mint UXDToken, accidentally calls the receive function and then his ETH is lost.

## Impact
Users can very easily lose ETH by accidentally executing the `receive` function.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the `receive` function such that the function call reverts if users provide an ETH value and do not call `UXDController.mintWithEth` with the correct argument types.
