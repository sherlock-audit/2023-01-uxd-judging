# Unused/empty `receive()` function

## Summary
user can loss funds if send directly to contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
If the intention is for the Ether to be used, the function should call another function, otherwise it should revert (e.g. require(msg.sender == address(weth)))
## Impact
user can send eth directly to the contract and there is no way for him to get it out
