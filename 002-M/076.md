# UXDController may lock up received Ether

## Summary

The receive function in `UXDController` may lead to locking up received ether from any user

## Vulnerability Detail

It is possible for any user to send ether to `UXDController` contract by `receive` function, this ether sent to the contract will be locked up forever because there isn't any function to return miss sending ether, this function should be only used by WETH contract to unwrap WETH

## Impact

Any unaware user may lose ether if sending to the contract using receive function

## Code Snippet

receive() external payable {}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding validation to check if msg.sender is a valid address to receive eth or a function to retrieve locked eth.
