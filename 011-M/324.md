# `PerpDepository` not compatible with `assetToken` with decimals different from 18

## Summary
In `PerpDepository` if `assetToken` does not have `18` decimals, then accounting issues arise in different places that will cause loss of funds

## Vulnerability Detail
While `clearingHouse.openPosition()` accepts `amount` with 18 decimals and returns `baseAmount` with 18 decimals, these input and output values come from or are fed to functions that accept `assetToken` native number of decimal.

- In `_placePerpOrder()` the variable `amountIsInput` is in `assetToken` decimals but is fed to `clearingHouse.openPosition()`. If for example `assetToken` has 8 decimals, then the order opened during a `mint` (short) is very small and only a very small amount of redeemable is sent to the `minter`, even if she deposited the full amount of `assetToken`

- in `PerpDepository.redeem()`, `base` is in 18 decimals, so in `_withdrawAsset()` a much larger amount of tokens respect to the redeemable is sent to the redeemer

- in `_rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap()` the return value of `_placePerpOrder()`, `quoteAmount`, is in 18 decimals, but is fed to `vault.withdraw()` and `spotSwapper.swapExactInput()` which both expects `assetToken` number of decimals. Similiar issue in `_rebalanceNegativePnlLite()`

Note that WBTC has 8 decimals and is currently in use in Perp protocol. If UXD integrates this token, funds will be lost.

## Impact
Accounting errors cause to send too small or too large amount of `baseAsset` during minting and redeeming. This causes loss of funds for the users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Always convert amounts of `assetToken` to / from 18 decimals before using as input to / output from `_placePerpOrder()`.
