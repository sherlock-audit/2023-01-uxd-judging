# Protocol doesn't handle fee on transfer tokens

## Summary

There are ERC20 tokens that charge a fee for every `transfer()` or `transferFrom()`. The current implementation assumes that the amount transfered is the same as the amount speficied.

## Vulnerability Detail

Functions such as `PerpDepository::_withdrawAsset, PerpDepository::_depositAsset` assume that the amount specified will be the actual amount transfered. This can lead to various side effects including wrong update of balances. An example is `netAssetDeposits` which is either incremented or decremented based on the amount specified and not the actual amount transfered.

```solidity
function _withdrawAsset(uint256 amount, address to) private {
        if (amount > netAssetDeposits) {
            revert InsufficientAssetDeposits(netAssetDeposits, amount);
        }
        netAssetDeposits -= amount;

        vault.withdraw(address(assetToken), amount);
        IERC20(assetToken).transfer(to, amount);
    }
```
## Impact

Incorrect accounting which could lead to breaking the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The protocol should compare token balances before and after transfers instead of relying on the specifed amount for transfer.
