# Return value of ERC20 transferFrom is unchecked in depositInsurance()

## Summary

In the `depositInsurance()` function of the PerpDepository contract, the return value of `IERC20(insuranceToken()).transferFrom(from, address(this), amount);` is not checked.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the call to transferFrom is done, if insufficient tokens are present, no revert occurs but a result of "false" is returned. This could lead to an assumption that a transfer from the account was done even if it failed.

## Impact

A failed transfer would lead to the wrong assumption that it had succeeded. This could lead to the wrong calculation of amount of insurance available at a certain point in time.

```solidity
function depositInsurance(uint256 amount, address from)
        external
        nonReentrant
        onlyOwner
    {
        if (amount == 0) {
            revert ZeroAmount();
        }
        uint256 allowance = IERC20(insuranceToken()).allowance(
            from,
            address(this)
        );
        if (allowance < amount) {
            revert NotApproved(allowance, amount);
        }

        insuranceDeposited += amount;

        IERC20(insuranceToken()).transferFrom(from, address(this), amount);
        IERC20(insuranceToken()).approve(address(vault), amount);
        vault.deposit(insuranceToken(), amount);

        emit InsuranceDeposited(msg.sender, from, amount);
    }
```

## Recommendation

Wrap the call into a require() or use openzeppelin's SafeERC20 library.
