# ERC20 `approve` fail for some tokens

## Summary
Some tokens (like `USDT`) do not work when changing the allowance from an
existing non-zero allowance value. They must first be approved by zero and then the actual allowance must be approved.

Also `approve()` will fail for certain token implementations that do not return a boolean value. Hence it is recommend to use `increaseAllowance()` and `decreaseAllowance()`

## Vulnerability Detail
`approve` reverts for tokens like USDT if first not approved to `0`
Use of `approve` over the code incosistently and not considered as best [practice](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L186)

## Impact
Reverting in some tokens like `USDT`, approve returning value not noticed

## Code Snippet
- Some ERC20 like `USDT` fail if not set first to `0`

- In this ones happens the same but also `approve` returning value is ignored

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Add 0 `approve` before `approve`
- Consider using `increaseAllowance`  and `decreaseAllowance` instead of `approve`
- Check return value values and `revert`/`emit` events if needed
