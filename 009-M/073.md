# PerpDepository calculates fees incorrectly

## Summary
PerpDepository calculates fees incorrectly
## Vulnerability Detail
When any position is opened by PerpDepository, then `_placePerpOrder` function is called. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L346-L375
```solidity
    function _placePerpOrder(
        uint256 amount,
        bool isShort,
        bool amountIsInput,
        uint160 sqrtPriceLimit
    ) private returns (uint256, uint256) {
        uint256 upperBound = 0; // 0 = no limit, limit set by sqrtPriceLimit


        IClearingHouse.OpenPositionParams memory params = IClearingHouse
            .OpenPositionParams({
                baseToken: market,
                isBaseToQuote: isShort, // true for short
                isExactInput: amountIsInput, // we specify exact input amount
                amount: amount, // collateral amount - fees
                oppositeAmountBound: upperBound, // output upper bound
                // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
                deadline: block.timestamp,
                sqrtPriceLimitX96: sqrtPriceLimit, // max slippage
                referralCode: 0x0
            });


        (uint256 baseAmount, uint256 quoteAmount) = clearingHouse.openPosition(
            params
        );
        uint256 feeAmount = _calculatePerpOrderFeeAmount(quoteAmount);
        totalFeesPaid += feeAmount;


        emit PositionOpened(isShort, amount, amountIsInput, sqrtPriceLimit);
        return (baseAmount, quoteAmount);
    }
```

In case if it's short, then `isBaseToQuote` param will be true and when it's long it will be false.
`clearingHouse.openPosition` returns `baseAmount` and `quoteAmount` params.
Later protocol is trying to calculate how much fees was paid to perp protocol using `_calculatePerpOrderFeeAmount(quoteAmount)`.
There are 2 problems here.
1.quoteAmount is the amount already without fee, so when you call `_calculatePerpOrderFeeAmount(quoteAmount)`, then you need to know original amount of quote tokens after swap.
2.Depending on `isBaseToQuote` param of `IClearingHouse.OpenPositionParams` perp protocol will take fees in base or quote token.
Here, Exhange will [replay swap](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-contract/blob/main/contracts/Exchange.sol#L454-L466) and will then calculate fees [based on `isBaseToQuote` param](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-contract/blob/main/contracts/OrderBook.sol#L318-L319).
According to that code if `isBaseToQuote` is true then fee is taken in base token by uniswap pool and uniswap pool fee is used. And when `isBaseToQuote` is false then fee is taken from quote token.

That means that depending on short or long positions in PerpDepository, fee should be calculated in different way and current calculation is incorrect and `totalFeesPaid` is also wrong.
## Impact
`totalFeesPaid` is calculated incorrectly, getCurrentState function shows wrong result.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You need to calculate and store fees separately for long and short operations.
