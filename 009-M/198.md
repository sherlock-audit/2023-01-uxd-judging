# Clearing house fees are stored in PerpDepository() but not paid

## Summary

Fees are calculated in PerpDepository() but not paid.

## Vulnerability Detail

When exchanging collateral for UXD through Perpetual Protocol, PerpDepository._placePerpOrder() is called. In _placePerpOrder, feeAmount is counted for the account and totalFeesPaid is tallied but the value is not subtracted from the amount.

This is the feeAmount in _placePerpOrder(), calculated by calling _calculatePerpOrderFeeAmount and passing in the quoteAmount. totalFeesPaid is the sum of all feeAmount.

        uint256 feeAmount = _calculatePerpOrderFeeAmount(quoteAmount);
        totalFeesPaid += feeAmount;

In the comments, amount should be the collateral amount - fees. However, the amount passed in is the base amount and not after fees deduction.

                amount: amount, // collateral amount - fees

The amount passed into the params struct should be after fees deduction.

## Impact

Clearing house fees are not paid.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Calculate the feesAmount first and subtract from the amount before passing the value into the params struct.

_placePerpOrder()

```solidity

+        uint256 feeAmount = _calculatePerpOrderFeeAmount(quoteAmount);
         IClearingHouse.OpenPositionParams memory params = IClearingHouse
             .OpenPositionParams({
                 baseToken: market,
                 isBaseToQuote: isShort, // true for short
                 isExactInput: amountIsInput, // we specify exact input amount
-                amount: amount, // collateral amount - fees
+                amount: amount - feeAmount, // collateral amount - fees
                 oppositeAmountBound: upperBound, // output upper bound
                 // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
                 deadline: block.timestamp,
                 sqrtPriceLimitX96: sqrtPriceLimit, // max slippage
                 referralCode: 0x0
             });


         (uint256 baseAmount, uint256 quoteAmount) = clearingHouse.openPosition(
             params
         );
-        uint256 feeAmount = _calculatePerpOrderFeeAmount(quoteAmount);
         totalFeesPaid += feeAmount;
