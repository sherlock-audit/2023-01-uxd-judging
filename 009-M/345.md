# Fee accounting for Perp positions is incorrect

## Summary

Placing a Perp order calculates the trading fees based on the `quoteAmount`. However, `quoteAmount`, returned by the `ClearingHouse.openPosition` function, has the fees already deducted. Therefore, the fees are calculated based on the amount that has fees deducted, which leads to incorrect and insufficient fee accounting.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `PerpDepository` contract uses the `ClearingHouse.openPosition` function to place Perp orders. The `ClearingHouse.openPosition` function returns the `baseAmount` and `quoteAmount` of the order. Based on the `quoteAmount`, the trading fees are calculated with the `PerpDepository._calculatePerpOrderFeeAmount` and accounted for in the `totalFeesPaid` storage variable.

However, the `quoteAmount` returned by the `ClearingHouse.openPosition` function has the trading fees already deducted ([see here](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-contract/blob/27ea8e2c4be37d1dd58c1eed3b3cc269d398a091/contracts/Exchange.sol#L534)). Therefore, the fees are calculated based on the amount that has fees deducted, which leads to incorrect and insufficient fee accounting.

## Impact

The total fees paid by placing Perp orders are incorrect and account for too few fees. The `totalFeesPaid` variable is currently only used by the `getCurrentState` function. However, as the `PerpDepository` contract is upgradeable, this could change and depending on the changes, could build on top of the incorrect fee accounting.

[integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L370](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L370)

```solidity
function _placePerpOrder(
    uint256 amount,
    bool isShort,
    bool amountIsInput,
    uint160 sqrtPriceLimit
) private returns (uint256, uint256) {
    // [...]

    (uint256 baseAmount, uint256 quoteAmount) = clearingHouse.openPosition(
        params
    );
    uint256 feeAmount = _calculatePerpOrderFeeAmount(quoteAmount);
    totalFeesPaid += feeAmount;

    emit PositionOpened(isShort, amount, amountIsInput, sqrtPriceLimit);
    return (baseAmount, quoteAmount);
}
```

```solidity

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider using the Perp `ClearingHouse.openPositionFor` function ([see docs](https://docs.perp.com/docs/contracts/ClearingHouse#openpositionfor)) which returns the trading fees as a third return value. Please note, that this function requires setting the appropriate delegate approval ([see docs](https://docs.perp.com/docs/contracts/DelegateApproval#approve)).
