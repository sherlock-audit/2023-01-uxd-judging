# Rage trade senior vault may deny withdrawals when lending utilization is high

## Summary
Under some conditions Rage trade senior vault may not allow withdrawal of funds, transitively leading users to be unable to redeem UXD.

## Vulnerability Detail
As can be seen in beforeWithdraw in Rage trade's senior vault:

```solidity
    function beforeWithdraw(
        uint256 assets,
        uint256,
        address
    ) internal override {
        /// @dev withdrawal will fail if the utilization goes above maxUtilization value due to a withdrawal
        // totalUsdcBorrowed will reduce when borrower (junior vault) repays
        if (totalUsdcBorrowed() > ((totalAssets() - assets) * maxUtilizationBps) / MAX_BPS)
            revert MaxUtilizationBreached();

        // take out required assets from aave lending pool
        pool.withdraw(address(asset), assets, address(this));
    }
```

the withdrawal attempt will revert if lending utilization is above the threshold.
