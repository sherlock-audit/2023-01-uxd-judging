# UXDController should allow redeem if collateral was removed from the whitelist

## Summary
When collateral is removed from the whitelist it is impossible to redeem tokens that were minted with that collateral

## Vulnerability Detail
It is entirely possible that the protocol would want to pause deposits for some collateral but allow withdrawals. Currently this is not the case. The protocol will have to halt withdrawals if collateral is to be removed from the whitelist.

## Impact
UXD token will depeg as a result

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Option 1: allow withdrawals even when collateral is not in the whitelist.
Option 2: introduce a separate function to just pause deposits for a specific collateral
