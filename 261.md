# `PerpDepository::rebalance` does not check if caller is authorized to use another user's account for shortfall transactions.

## Summary

Anyone can call `PerpDepository::rebalance` and use another user's account for shortfall transactions without authorization.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user calls `PerpDepository::rebalance` and specifies another user's address as the `account`, the only requirement is that the `account` must have pre-approved the contract to spend `quoteToken`. Therefore anyone who has approved the contract to spend their `quoteToken` can have their address used when the function is being called.

```solidity
 /// For negative PnL, account must have pre-approved this contract to spend quoteToken.
    /// For positive PnL, account must have pre-approved this contract to spend assetToken.
    /// The maximum amount that must be transferred from account = swap fees + slippage.
    function rebalance(
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 amountOutMinimum,
        uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96,
        uint24 swapPoolFee,
        int8 polarity,
        address account
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256, uint256) {
```

The account specified will then be used to cover any shorfall

```solidity
        int256 shortFall = int256(
            quoteAmount.fromDecimalToDecimal(18, ERC20(quoteToken).decimals())
        ) - int256(quoteAmountOut);
        if (shortFall > 0) {
            IERC20(quoteToken).transferFrom(
                account,
                address(this),
                uint256(shortFall)
            );
        } else if (shortFall < 0) {
            // we got excess tokens in the spot swap. Send them to the account paying for rebalance
            IERC20(quoteToken).transfer(
                account,
                _abs(shortFall)
            );
        }
```

A user could have previously approved the contract when interacting with the protocol.

## Impact

This would lead to a user losing their funds as their account would be used to cover the shortfall.

## Recommendation

Whitelist accounts that can be used to cover a shortfall.
