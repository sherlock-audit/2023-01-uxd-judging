# Missing setController method in RageDnDepository

## Summary
`setController` method which allows the owner to set the controller's address is missing in RageDnDepository.
## Vulnerability Detail
As we can check in the PerpDepository contract, there is a method `[setController]`(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L144). This method is not added in RageDnDepository which also uses `controller` with the same priority.

This may lead to the owner not being able to update the controller address in RageDnDepository and might require a re-deployment of the RageDnDepository contract which can be troublesome.

## Impact
Unable to update `controller` contract address in RageDnDepository contract.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the following method to the RageDnDepository contract.

`

     function setController(address _controller) external onlyOwner {
        require(_controller.isContract(), "Address not contract");
        controller = _controller;
    }

`
