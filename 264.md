# use maybe can not redeem()

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

In the UXDController
1. When executing to deposit the assetToken, it will mint the corresponding UXDToken to the user
2. executing UXDToken.burn() to retrieve the corresponding assetToken

In the current implementation, UXDToken.sol has a variable localMintAmount to record the number of remaining tokens in the mint/burn of the above UXDController. and check localMintAmount<=localMintCap

Since UXDToken exists in multiple chains, it is possible to synchronize other chains to the current chain by layer-zero, so localMintAmount is used to record the local token of the current chain.

But there is a problem.
The tokens from other chains are mixed together and cannot be distinguished from each other.
As a result, the localMintAmount does not increase for tokens generated by lazy-zero, but will decreases when the token generated by lazy-zero is burned.

Example:
1. alice executes UXDController.mint(), and gets 100 uxd
now: 
totalSupply = 100
localMintAmount = 100

2. bob get 100 uxd by lazy-zero
now: 
totalSupply = 200 (100+100)
localMintAmount = 100 (still 100)

3. bob executes UXDController.redeem() then UXDToken.burn(100)
now: 
totalSupply = 100 (200-100)
localMintAmount = 0 (100-100)

4.alice also executes UXDController.redeem() and then UXDToken.burn(100),will fail
now: 
totalSupply = 0 (100-100)
localMintAmount = -100 (0-100,will revert)

This step  will fail，Because：
1.localMintAmount -=100 will revert
2.the assetToken may not be enough.(bob use non-local token to redeem)


The result is
alice from UXDController.mint() but can not redeem()

So it is recommended that
1: non-local tokens be burned and that the localMintAmount not be reduced.
This can be achieved by recording the current local token balance corresponding to each user.

2.As to whether non-local tokens can execute UXDController.redeem() or not, it depends on the system requirements

## Impact

Normal user can mint(), but can not redeem()

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a record of the current local token balance for each user

```solidity
contract UXDToken is Ownable, ERC20Permit, OFT, IRedeemable {

+   mapping(address => uint256) public localBalance;

    function mint(address account, uint256 amount) external onlyController {
        localMintAmount += amount;
+       localBalance[account] +=amount;
        _checkLocalMint();
        _mint(account, amount);
        emit Minted(account, amount);
    }

    function burn(address account, uint256 amount) external onlyController {
+       uint256 reduceLocalAmount = localBalance[account] > amount? amount : localBalance[account]; //Priority burn local token
+       localBalance[account]-= reduceLocalAmount;
+       localMintAmount -= reduceLocalAmount;        
+       //require(reduceLocalAmount==amount,"Not enough local token");   // turn this on to prevent not enough local token to redeem (like bob) 
-       localMintAmount -= amount;
        if (account != msg.sender) {
            _spendAllowance(account, msg.sender, amount);
        }
        _burn(account, amount);
        emit Burned(account, amount);
    }

+   function _afterTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal override {
+       super._afterTokenTransfer(from,to,amount);
+       if(from!=address(0) && to!=address(0)){ //Ignore mint/burn
+           uint256 reduceLocalAmount = localBalance[from] > amount? amount : localBalance[from]; //Priority transfer local token
+           localBalance[from]-= reduceLocalAmount;
+           localBalance[to]+= reduceLocalAmount;
+        }
    }

```
