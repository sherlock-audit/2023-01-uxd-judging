# UXDGovernor may not be able to transfer token

## Summary
UXDGovernor.transferERC20() uses IERC20(token).transfer() to transfer the token and check the return value, but some tokens have no return value, such as including USDT and BNB. These tokens will always fail even if there is enough balance

## Vulnerability Detail

Since the IERC20 interface requires a boolean return value, attempting to transfer ERC20s with [missing return values](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#missing-return-values) will revert

```solidity
    function transferERC20(
        address token,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyGovernance nonReentrant {
        if (!(IERC20(token).transfer(to, amount))) { //***@audit if token==USDT Will always revert //
            revert GovERC20TransferFailed(token, to, amount);
        }
    }
```

UXDTimelockController has the same problem

## Impact

 Some tokens such as (USDT, BNB) cannot be executed transferERC20 ()
