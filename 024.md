# Lack of Contract existence check might lead to silent transfer fails

## Summary
The solidity documentation on low-level functions states *" The low-level functions call, delegatecall and staticcall return true as their first return value if the account called is non-existent, as part of the design of the EVM. Account existence must be checked prior to calling if needed "* 

The `UXDController` contract performs low-level calls as shown here : https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDController.sol#L304-L305. 

However, there is no contract existence check ascertaining that a contract exists. If the `receiver` input by the user via `redeemForEth ()` function is a contract that is yet to be deployed the low level call here: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDController.sol#L304-L305. would return success even though the transfer was not really executed. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The contract performs the following low-level call shown here: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDController.sol#L304-L305 but does not check if the contract exists or not. If the contract does not exist such that it has been destroyed or has not yet been deployed the transaction would be successful.

## Impact
Potential loss of funds if the contract does not exist

## Recommendation
Consider checking for contract existence when performing low level calls.
