# Inaccurate fee calculation

## Summary

There is a `totalFeesPaid` state variable in PerpDepository that tracks the fees paid. The fee calculation in PerpDepository is only correct when `isBaseToQuote` is false in `_openLong`. When `_placePerpOrder` is called by `_openShort`, the fee added to `totalFeesPaid` does not match the fee taken by perpetual protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

Perpetual protocol operates by minting [virtual tokens](https://perpprotocol.mirror.xyz/8ygBlS_2sJclQanTMpWTlOpeBKpA2fAP1HttLESDWCI) which can then be swapped in a Uniswap pool to achieve the proper long or short position. Perpetual protocol has a fee of 0.1% [as documented by the protocol](https://perpprotocol.mirror.xyz/vdazWT24PLDoPeWfxWtWXP0zKY9Cachvu0Rtype09tg). The Uniswap pool takes a fee of 0.3% per swap. [A good diagram showing the accumulation of fees](https://www.figma.com/file/xuue5qGH4RalX7uAbbzgP3/swap-accounting-%26-events?node-id=0%3A1) is found in [a comment in the Perpetual Protocol](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-contract/blob/27ea8e2c4be37d1dd58c1eed3b3cc269d398a091/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L895). In short, the total fee applied by perpetual swap is not a flat 0.1%. The calculation is more complex and the value of `isBaseToQuote` plays a key role in calculating the fees of perpetual protocol because of [this line](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-contract/blob/27ea8e2c4be37d1dd58c1eed3b3cc269d398a091/contracts/OrderBook.sol#L320) and [another line](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-contract/blob/27ea8e2c4be37d1dd58c1eed3b3cc269d398a091/contracts/OrderBook.sol#L320). The first line shows how `isBaseToQuote` changes which fee percentage is used and the second line shows how another fee amount applies only if `isBaseToQuote` is true.

For an on-chain example, look at this transaction trace https://tx.eth.samczsun.com/optimism/0x92135dfb75a3e2ebcdbc1dfd844e0301061f5b8ef02811da4f9363cf6ec3a6a0

The transaction is similar to what PerpDepository does [in these lines](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L334-L339) and [in these lines](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L354-369). It calls clearingHouse.openPosition with function arguments of isBaseToQuote=true, isExactInput=true, amount=uint256, oppositeAmountBound=0. The fee is `396463678078994422` and the quote is `396067214400915427396`. The quote should be multiplied by `0.001001001001001001` or 0.1001001001% to obtain the fee amount. This is not the same as the oversimplified 0.1% fee multiplier [which is used in `getExchangeFeeWad`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L794-L797).

To demonstrate further the impact of the `isBaseToQuote` value on the fee, simulating the same transaction in Tenderly with `isBaseToQuote` set to false returns a fee amount of `24600000000000002` and `24600000000000002/24600000000000001421=0.1%`. This confirms the on-chain contract code works as described above and the fee is dependent on the value of `isBaseToQuote`.

## Impact

PerpDepository maintains an inaccurate record of fees paid to Perpetual Protocol by oversimplifying the fee calculation. The fees are higher than expected and this results in less value returned to the user than anticipated.

## Code Snippet

The `totalFeesPaid` value is modified in only one place in `_placePerpOrder`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L370-L371

The calculation in `_calculatePerpOrderFeeAmount` multiplies the amount by 0.1%, which is the exchangeFeeRatio. This is not an accurate reflection of the total fees charged by perpetual protocol
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L338

This line in perpetual protocol shows the fee calculation is not so simple, and at minimum depends on `isBaseToQuote`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`clearingHouse.openPosition` does not include a fees value in the return values, [but `clearingHouse.openPositionFor` does](https://docs.perp.com/docs/contracts/ClearingHouse/#openpositionfor). Instead of recreating the fee calculations that perpetual protocol does, use the fees value returned by perpetual protocol and replace `clearingHouse.openPosition` with `clearingHouse.openPositionFor` to use the `fee` return value.
