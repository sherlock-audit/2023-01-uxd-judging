# UXDGovernor and UXDTimelockController transferERC20 function doesn't handle tokens that doesn't return boolean

## Summary
UXDGovernor and UXDTimelockController transferERC20 function doesn't handle tokens that doesn't return boolean. As result if such token needs to be transferred, then the function will revert.
## Vulnerability Detail
UXDGovernor and UXDTimelockController transferERC20 function expects that token ERC20.transfer function will return bool param as result.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/governance/UXDTimelockController.sol#L62-L66
```solidity
     function transferERC20(address token, address to, uint256 amount) external onlySelf nonReentrant  {
        if (!(IERC20(token).transfer(to, amount))) {
            revert TimelockERC20TransferFailed(token, to, amount);
        }
    }
```

But some tokens doesn't return any boolean in result. In such cases current function will always revert because of type casting error.
That means that it will be not possible to transfer such tokens.
## Impact
It is not possible to transfer ERC20 tokens that doesn't return bool param.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You need to handle both cases, when bool result is returned and when not.
