# Redeeming all UXD tokens is not possible if some have been minted via Perp quote minting

## Summary

If some UXD tokens have been minted via Perp quote minting (i.e. `USDC` - due to negative PnL), rather than asset minting (i.e. `WETH`), redeeming all UXD tokens is not possible anymore due to not accounting for quote minting in the `netAssetDeposits` variable.

## Vulnerability Detail

The Perp integration allows users to deposit assets and return the redeemable (UXD) amount that can be minted. Assets can be deposited in two ways: either `assetToken` or `quoteToken`. `quoteToken` (i.e., `USDC`) can only be deposited if there's a negative PnL > `amount` to pay off the negative PnL.

Depositing `assetToken` (i.e., `WETH`) increases the internal accounting variable `netAssetDeposits`, which is the amount of `assetToken` deposited minus the amount of `assetToken` withdrawn. Withdrawing `assetToken` decreases `netAssetDeposits` by the amount withdrawn.

However, depositing `quoteToken` (if available) does not increase the `netAssetDeposits` variable. This leads to more `UXD` tokens being minted than `assetToken` deposited.

Thus, redeeming all `UXD` tokens is not possible anymore if some `UXD` tokens have been minted via quote minting. Users who are left last with redeeming their UXD tokens cannot do so.

**Consider the following example:**

- `assetToken` = `WETH`
- `quoteToken` = `USDC`
- `1 ether` of `WETH` = `1_000e6` `USDC` = `1_000e18` UXD
- Negative PnL occurs during deposits because of market volatility

| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| T0   | Alice deposits `10 ether` of `assetToken`                              | `10 ether`         | `10_000e18` |
| T1   | Bob deposits `10 ether` of `assetToken`                                | `20 ether`         | `20_000e18` |
| T2   | Caroline deposits `1_000e6` of `quoteToken` (due to negative PnL)      | `20 ether`         | `21_000e18` |
| T10  | Caroline redeems `1_000e18 UXD` via `1 ether` `assetToken`             | `19 ether`         | `20_000e18` |
| T11  | Bob redeems `10_000e18 UXD` via `10 ether` `assetToken`                | `9 ether`          | `10_000e18` |
| T12  | Alice redeems `10_000e18 UXD` via `10 ether` `assetToken` -> **fails** | `9 ether`          | `10_000e18` |

Alice is not able to redeem her balance of `10_000e18 UXD` because `netAssetDeposits = 9 ether` is insufficient to redeem `10_000e18 UXD = 10 ether`.

## Impact

UXD tokens can not be fully redeemed via the Perp depository if some have been minted via quote minting.

## Code Snippet

Asset token deposits increase the internal accounting variable `netAssetDeposits` by the amount deposited.

```solidity
/// @notice Deposits collateral to back the delta-neutral position
/// @dev Only called by the controller
/// @param amount The amount to deposit
function _depositAsset(uint256 amount) private {
    netAssetDeposits += amount;

    IERC20(assetToken).approve(address(vault), amount);
    vault.deposit(assetToken, amount);
}
```

[integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L298](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L298)

Withdrawing asset tokens (i.e. `WETH`) decreases the internal accounting variable `netAssetDeposits` by the amount withdrawn and thus limits the amount of redeemable UXD tokens to `netAssetDeposits`.

```solidity
/// @notice Withdraws collateral to used in the delta-neutral position.
/// @dev This should only happen when redeeming UXD for collateral.
/// Only called by the controller.
/// @param amount The amount to deposit
function _withdrawAsset(uint256 amount, address to) private {
    if (amount > netAssetDeposits) {
        revert InsufficientAssetDeposits(netAssetDeposits, amount);
    }
    netAssetDeposits -= amount;

    vault.withdraw(address(assetToken), amount);
    IERC20(assetToken).transfer(to, amount);
}
```

[integrations/perp/PerpDepository.redeem](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L264)

Redeeming via quote tokens is disabled. Only redeeming via `assetToken` is possible. Thus, leaving no other option than to redeem via `assetToken`.

```solidity
function redeem(
        address asset,
    uint256 amount
) external onlyController returns (uint256) {
    if (asset == assetToken) {
        (uint256 base, ) = _openLong(amount);
        _withdrawAsset(base, address(controller));
        return base;
    } else if (asset == quoteToken) {
        revert QuoteRedeemDisabled(msg.sender);
        // return _processQuoteRedeem(amount);
    } else {
        revert UnsupportedAsset(asset);
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider changing the internal accounting of `netAssetDeposits` to include `quoteToken` deposits.
