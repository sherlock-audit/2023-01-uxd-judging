# signature in delegateBySig can be reused on another chain

## Summary
According to the docs, the protocol will be deployed on mainnet, arbitrum, optimism. However, `delegateBySig` in `ERC20Votes` does not use chain id when reconstructing the signature. Therefore, an attacker can reuse the signature intended on one chain on another chain where the victim does not intend to delegate the votes.

## Vulnerability Detail
`UXDCouncilToken` and `UXPToken` inherits  `ERC20Votes` by OpenZepellin. Both do not override delegateBySig and hence both uses the OpenZepellin implementation. As you can see in this implementation, no chain id is used to reconstruct the signature. Therefore, a signature intended for one chain can be reused on another chain where the delegator does not intend on delegating.
  
```solidity
    function delegateBySig(
        address delegatee,
        uint256 nonce,
        uint256 expiry,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) public virtual override {
        require(block.timestamp <= expiry, "ERC20Votes: signature expired");
        address signer = ECDSA.recover(
            _hashTypedDataV4(keccak256(abi.encode(_DELEGATION_TYPEHASH, delegatee, nonce, expiry))),
            v,
            r,
            s
        );
        require(nonce == _useNonce(signer), "ERC20Votes: invalid nonce");
        _delegate(signer, delegatee);
    }

```


## Impact
Voting power can be delegated even though delegator does not intend on delegating.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend overriding `delegateBySig` and using chain.id when reconstructing the signature. This also requires the off chain side to use chain id when constructing the signature.
