# Tokens can get trapped in the PerpDepository contract

## Summary

There is not direct way to withdraw tokens that may get trapped in the contract. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The `PerpDepository` contract has functionality that involves movement of tokens to and from the vault.  Functions such as `depositInsurance()` use the address of `PerpDepository` as an in between step in the transfer of tokens. There is possibility of tokens getting trapped in the contract either due to wrong address specification of failure of various token transfer functions within the contract. If this happens, there is no backup plan on a way to withdraw tokens from the contract.

## Impact

Tokens could be permanently lost if trapped in the contract.

```solidity
        IERC20(insuranceToken()).transferFrom(from, address(this), amount);
        IERC20(insuranceToken()).approve(address(vault), amount);
        vault.deposit(insuranceToken(), amount);
```
