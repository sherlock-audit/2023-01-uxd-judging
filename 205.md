# [NAZ-H1] Any Account That Has `PerpDepository.sol` Approved as Spender of `quoteToken` Can be Forced To Pay Shortfall

## Summary
Any account that has `PerpDepository.sol` approved as spender of `quoteToken` can be forced to pay shortfall.

## Vulnerability Detail
`rebalance()` is a function used to rebalance negative PNL by the amount in quote token. It takes an `account` parameter to which is used in the future after a spot swap is conducted to either pay the shortfall or receive additional funds not needed for rebalancing. 

## Impact
If a malicious actor were to know that they were going to have to pay a shortfall, they could just use any account that has pre-approved `PerpDepository.sol` to spend `quoteToken`. Thus forcing them to pay the difference unknowingly losing funds.

## Code Snippet
[`PerpDepository.sol#L446`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L446)

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider removing the `account` parameter and using `msg.sender` instead to be the `account` that covers the difference.
