# Corruptible Upgradeability pattern

## Summary

Storage of `UXDController` might be corrupted on upgrade. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `UXDController` contract is meant to be upgradeable . However , the contracts it inherits are not upgrade safe.

Storage gaps are a convention for reserving storage slots in base contracts. This allows future versions of the child contracts to be safe during upgradation.

Below is the contract inheritance chart of `UXDController` .

`UXDController` inherits 4 contracts. The contracts with yellow colour have defined a storage gap , but contracts with purple have not defined any .

## Impact
Adding any new storage in `UXDControllerStorage` , will corrupt the storage slots of `UXDController`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a storage gap in `UXDControllerStorage` like this 

```solidity

abstract contract UXDControllerStorage {
 
     /// @notice The token to be minted and burned
@@ -24,4 +26,6 @@ abstract contract UXDControllerStorage {
 
     /// weth address
     address public weth;
+
+    uint[40] private _gap;
 }

```

Note this does not cost any extra gas .
