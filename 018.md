# uxdController isn't using safeTransfer for ERC20 Transfers

## Summary
When handling ERC20 based user deposits, the UXDController isn't using safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom.

## Vulnerability Detail
UXPController.mint() function solely relies on a revert of the ERC20 contract. Should UXP Protocol in the future use ERC20 contracts that fail silently or return (bool false) when a transaction fails, this could result lost funds to the protocol.

## Impact
High.

Loss of funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use SafeERC20 Wrappers. 
Wrappers around ERC20 operations that throw on failure (when the token contract returns false). Tokens that return no value (and instead revert or throw on failure) are also supported, non-reverting calls are assumed to be successful. To use this library you can add a using `SafeERC20 for ERC20; `statement to your contract, which allows you to call the safe operations as `token.safeTransfer(…​)`, etc.
