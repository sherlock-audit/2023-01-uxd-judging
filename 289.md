# Missing slippage protection

## Summary

There are no minimum amounts out, or checks that frontrunning/slippage is sufficiently mitigated. This means that anyone with enough capital can force arbitrarily large slippage by sandwiching transactions, close to 100%. See issue page for referenced code.

sqrtPriceLimitX96: the restriction on the ending price after the swap. 0 for no limit. This is the same as sqrtPriceLimitX96 in the Uniswap V3 contract.


## Impact

Possible loss of liquidity

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend adding a minimum amount out parameter. The function should revert if the minimum amount isn't obtained.
