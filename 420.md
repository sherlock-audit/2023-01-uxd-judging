# Rebalancing issues

## Summary

Rebalancing is a crucial part of the protocol. But there are some issues with it:

## Vulnerability Detail

1. Rebalancing can't be performed if ``PerpDepository.spotSwapper`` not set 
2. You have rebalancing only for negative PnL

## Impact

Unbalanced circulation of UXD may lead to overinflation or opposite result. Both ways are bad for the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Because ``spotSwapper`` is a critical variable, save it in the contract constructor
2. Add functions to do rebalancing in case of positive PnL (uncomment)
