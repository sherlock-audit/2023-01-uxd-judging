# `PerpDepository::_rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap` does not update netAssetDeposits

## Summary

When `PerpDepository::_rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap` is called during a rebalance, the protocol will lose track of the `netAssetDeposits` amount as it is not updated. Note that this also affects `PerpDepository::_rebalanceNegativePnlLite` in a similar manner.

## Vulnerability Detail

`netAssetDeposits` is used to track the the total amount of asset token collateral deposited minus amount redeemed according to code comments. When `PerpDepository::_rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap` is called, the `assetToken` is withdrawn and swapped for the `quoteToken`.

```solidity
        vault.withdraw(assetToken, baseAmount);
        SwapParams memory params = SwapParams({
            tokenIn: assetToken,
            tokenOut: quoteToken,
            amountIn: baseAmount,
            amountOutMinimum: amountOutMinimum,
            sqrtPriceLimitX96: sqrtPriceLimitX96,
            poolFee: swapPoolFee
        });
        uint256 quoteAmountOut = spotSwapper.swapExactInput(params);
```

The value of `netAssetDeposits` therefore should be reduced to account for this. This is important because of the check in `PerpDepository::_withdrawAsset` which requires amount to be withdrawn be less than `netAssetDeposits`.

```solidity
    function _withdrawAsset(uint256 amount, address to) private {
        if (amount > netAssetDeposits) {
            revert InsufficientAssetDeposits(netAssetDeposits, amount);
        }
        netAssetDeposits -= amount;

        vault.withdraw(address(assetToken), amount);
        IERC20(assetToken).transfer(to, amount);
    }
```

After a `_rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap` is done, the amount that can be withdrawn in form of the assetToken will have reduced but `netAssetDeposits` will still register a higher value.

## Impact

This will break the protocol functionality as `netAssetDeposits` will have a higher value than what the protocol has in the depository.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update the value as `netAssetDeposits -= baseAmount` in the `_rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap` function. This should also be done for the `_rebalanceNegativePnlLite` function.
