# If external depository contract is paused, the mint and redeem transaction is guarantee to revert.

## Summary

If external contract is paused, the mint and redeem transaction is guarantee to revert. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation,

The mint flow is:

The user needs to call

mint with UXDController -> call deposit / open postion with perp protocol 

or 

mint with UXDController -> call deposit with rage trade senior vault

The redeem flow is:

The user needs to call

redeem with UXDController -> call withdraw / close position with perp protocol

or

redeem with UXDController -> call withdraw with rage trade senior vault

However, the external integration for both rage trade senior vault and perp protocol vault and cleaning house can pause the action, which block UXD mint and redeem, but the UXD protocol is not able to pause the redeem or mint function.

Rage trade senior vault deposit function has WhenNotPaused modifier

```solidity
function deposit(uint256 amount, address to)
	public
	virtual
	override(IERC4626, ERC4626Upgradeable)
	whenNotPaused
	returns (uint256 shares)
{
	// harvesting fees so asset to shares conversion rate is not stale
	dnGmxJuniorVault.harvestFees();
	shares = super.deposit(amount, to);
}
```

Rage trade senior vault withdraw function has WhenNotPaused modifier as well

```solidity
function withdraw(
	uint256 assets,
	address receiver,
	address owner
) public override(IERC4626, ERC4626Upgradeable) whenNotPaused returns (uint256 shares) {
	// harvesting fees so asset to shares conversion rate is not stale
	dnGmxJuniorVault.harvestFees();
	shares = super.withdraw(assets, receiver, owner);
}
```

Perp curie contract vault deposit function has WhenNotPaused modifier.

```solidity

{
	// input requirement checks:
	//   token: here
	//   amount: _deposit

	address from = _msgSender();
	_deposit(from, from, token, amount);
}
```

Perp curie contract vault withdraw function has WhenNotPaused modifier as well.

```solidity

	external
	override
	whenNotPaused
	nonReentrant
	onlySettlementOrCollateralToken(token)
{
	// input requirement checks:
	//   token: here
	//   amount: in _settleAndDecreaseBalance()

	address to = _msgSender();
	_withdraw(to, token, amount);
}
```

## Impact

If external protocol integration pause the deposit / withdraw / trade, the mint and redeem of UXD is blocked.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol add a pause modiifer to mint and redeem so when external protocol pause the deposit / withdraw / trade, the admin of the UXD can also pause the redeem and mint action to avoid let user suffer a guarantee-to-revert transaction.

The protocol can also implement a fail-safe mechanism: when external contract is paused, let the user exit via the Uniswap Liquidity by swapping UXD to underlying asset.
