# Safe IERC20

## Summary
There are many locations in which SafeERC should be used. Even if the contract is sitting behind a proxy like in `UXDController.sol`, including this is the first version can allow for easier/less errors when later trying to upgrade the implementation version. Additionally, since tokens can be added, this would prevent tokens that do not return `bool` as they are supposed to from being bricked from use. 

## Vulnerability Detail
SafeERC requires that ERC20 interactions A. complete successfully even if a return value isn't provided and B. Boolean values so that your code does not need to. 

## Impact
Prevents correct transactions from being rejected and certain tokens from being bricked all together. 

## Code Snippet
Here is an example, however this can be used any time an ERC function is called on an external token.

    using SafeERC20Upgradeable for IERC20Upgradeable;
    ...
}
