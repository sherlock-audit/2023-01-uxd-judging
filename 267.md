# Internal accounting can be miscalculated

## Summary

On the external interaction through the vaults, return amount is not checked on the protocol. Instead of this, directly asset amount is considered. If the external protocol takes any fee from deposits, full internal account will be broken.

## Vulnerability Detail

On the external interaction through the vaults, return amount is not checked on the protocol. Instead of this, directly asset amount is considered. If the external protocol takes any fee from deposits, full internal account will be broken.

Same issue is valid for withdraw operation on the vault.

## Impact

Internal accounting fully will be broken and assets can not be redeemed.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/rage-trade/RageDnDepository.sol#L109

```solidity
    function deposit(address asset, uint256 assetAmount)
        external
        onlyController
        returns (uint256)
    {
        if (asset != assetToken) {
            revert UnsupportedAsset(asset);
        }
        netAssetDeposits += assetAmount;
        IERC20(assetToken).approve(address(vault), assetAmount);
        uint256 shares = vault.deposit(assetAmount, address(this));
        uint256 redeemableAmount = _assetsToRedeemable(assetAmount);
        redeemableUnderManagement += redeemableAmount;
        _checkSoftCap();
        emit Deposited(msg.sender, assetAmount, redeemableAmount, shares);
        return redeemableAmount;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider using return of amount shares on the `_assetsToRedeemable` function.
