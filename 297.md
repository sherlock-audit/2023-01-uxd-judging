# UXD protocol does not support fee on transfer/rebasing/deflationary tokens

## Summary

The UXD protocol does not support fee on transfer/rebasing/deflationary tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

The UXD protocol assumes that the amount transferred from the source address is what will be credited to the destination address. This is not the case for fee on transfer/rebasing/deflationary tokens. Notably, USDT has the ability to charge a fee on `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`, and USDC is upgradeable, which means that it is possible that a fee is implemented in a future version of the stablecoin.

## Impact

The inner accounting system of the contract breaks for fee on transfer/rebasing/deflationary. 

The protocol receives fewer tokens than expected, and may mint more collateral to users than what they are entitled to.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDController.sol#L195-L199

```solidity
        collateral.transferFrom(
            account,
            depository,
            assetAmount
        );
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Verify if the amount transferred is indeed what was expected. See the example below. Apply the same recommendation on all other instances of ERC-20 token transfers.
