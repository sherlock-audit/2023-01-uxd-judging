# UXD cross-chain logic can lead to a lack of collateral

## Summary
Sending UXD to another network will result in a lack of collateral on the initial network and a surplus on the final network.
## Vulnerability Detail
The UXD token supports cross-chain transfer to networks on which core contracts have been deployed.
```solidity
abstract contract OFTCore is NonblockingLzApp, ERC165, IOFTCore {

  // ...

  function _send(address _from, uint16 _dstChainId, bytes memory _toAddress, uint _amount, address payable _refundAddress, address _zroPaymentAddress, bytes memory _adapterParams) internal virtual {
      _checkAdapterParams(_dstChainId, PT_SEND, _adapterParams, NO_EXTRA_GAS);

      uint amount = _debitFrom(_from, _dstChainId, _toAddress, _amount);

      bytes memory lzPayload = abi.encode(PT_SEND, _toAddress, amount);
      _lzSend(_dstChainId, lzPayload, _refundAddress, _zroPaymentAddress, _adapterParams, msg.value);

      emit SendToChain(_dstChainId, _from, _toAddress, amount);
  }

  function _sendAck(uint16 _srcChainId, bytes memory, uint64, bytes memory _payload) internal virtual {
      (, bytes memory toAddressBytes, uint amount) = abi.decode(_payload, (uint16, bytes, uint));

      address to = toAddressBytes.toAddress(0);

      amount = _creditTo(_srcChainId, to, amount);
      emit ReceiveFromChain(_srcChainId, to, amount);
  }
}

contract OFT is OFTCore, ERC20, IOFT {

  // ...

  function _debitFrom(address _from, uint16, bytes memory, uint _amount) internal virtual override returns(uint) {
      address spender = _msgSender();
      if (_from != spender) _spendAllowance(_from, spender, _amount);
      _burn(_from, _amount);
      return _amount;
  }

  function _creditTo(uint16, address _toAddress, uint _amount) internal virtual override returns(uint) {
      _mint(_toAddress, _amount);
      return _amount;
  }
}
```

The vulnerability lies in improper logic for sending UXD to another network, as the token is transmitted and the collateral remains the same. This can cause one of the networks to become unbalanced and the `redeem()` function to stop working as its depository runs out of funds.
## Impact
If there is a lack of collateral, redemption will not be possible. All users on the network that ran out of collateral will be affected. They will need to send their UXDs to another network.

## Tool used
Manual Review, VSCodium, Hardhat
## Recommendation
The logic for sending tokens between networks must be changed. The basic rule is that collateral must also be distributed along with the tokens.
Here are some possible solutions to the issue:
- Disabling the ability to send UXDs between networks.
- Informing users about the possible need to send a token to another network for redemption (the current documentation does not mention this anywhere).
- Implementation of a mechanism for rebalancing collaterals between deposits of different networks based on the current UXD supply on these networks.
- Instead of tokens, send collaterals:
 1. Redeem UXD -> WETH in a forwarding transaction to another network;
 2. The resulting output WETH is forwarded to the destination network;
 3. In the destination network, launch Mint WETH -> UXD.
