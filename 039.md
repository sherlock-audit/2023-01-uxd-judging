# ERC20 tokens that don't return a boolean value won't be transferrable with UXDTimelockController's & UXDGovernor's `transferERC20()`

## Summary
The `UXDTimelockController's & UXDGovernor's `transferERC20()` function is supposed to be used to transfer the contract's ERC20 tokens through governance proposals, see [here](https://docs.uxd.fi/uxdprogram-ethereum/governance/governance-proposals#transfer-erc-20-tokens), and [here](https://github.com/UXDProtocol/uxd-evm/blob/dedaub-audit/scripts/governance/9_transfer_erc20_proposal.ts). But, ERC20 tokens that don't return a boolean value cause the function to revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens, most prominently [USDT](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code#L126), don't return a boolean value. Thus, the zero-value is used which is `false`. That triggers a revert statement in the `transferERC20()` function.

## Impact
The designated function to transfer ERC20 tokens can't handle prominent tokens like USDT. But, that doesn't cause the funds to be locked up. The Timelock controller can execute arbitrary contract calls through its `execute()` function. Thus, you can schedule a call to the USDT contract to transfer the funds. Still thought that it's worth bringing this up since the devs deliberately added a function to transfer ERC20 tokens. 

## Code Snippet
```sol
    /// @notice Transfer ERC20 tokens out of this contract
    /// @dev Can only be called by governance.
    /// @param token The ERC20 token address.
    /// @param to The address to transfer token to
    /// @param amount The amount to transfer
    function transferERC20(
        address token,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyGovernance nonReentrant {
        if (!(IERC20(token).transfer(to, amount))) {
            revert GovERC20TransferFailed(token, to, amount);
        }
    }
```

## Recommendation
Use SafeERC20 when interacting with arbitrary tokens.
