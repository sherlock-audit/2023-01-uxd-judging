# # Unprotected `initialize` in upgradeable contract

## Summary
Anyone can call initialize and set their `ownership` and a custom `weth` address. As this contract is upgradeable, not only this can cause problems related to some relevant functions being locked, but also contract can be destroyed as of the upgradeable operations.

## Vulnerability Detail
Lack of access control at `initialize` can destroy upgradeable contracts

## Impact
Ownership front-runned and lost, contract being destroyed calling `upgradeTo` or `upgradeToAndCall` from [UUPSUpgradeable](node_modules/@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol)
