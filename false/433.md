# calculating Fullmatch:: MulDiv avoiding Overflow/Underflow

## Summary
An overflow/underflow happens when an arithmetic operation reaches the maximum or minimum size of a type. For instance if a number is stored in the uint8 type, it means that the number is stored in a 8 bits unsigned number ranging from 0 to 2^8-1. In computer programming, an integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of bits â€“ either larger than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value. Arithmetic overflow refers to the phenomenon where the numbers stored in a variable are too large for the variable to handle. And underflow is the opposite, where the amount is too small for the variable to store and handle.

## Vulnerability Detail
type uint256 ,uint256 can only store non-negative numbers from 0 to `(2**256 -1)`, Since the current maximum possible amount that can be stored is `(2**256 -1)` for uint256, if we add 1 to it, making it `(2**256)`, the variable overflows, causing it to reset to 0. Similarly, if the variable is set to 0 and the arithmetic function tries to modify the variable by subtracting 1, the variable underflows and becomes `(2**256)`.

## Impact
``` solidity  
 function mulDiv(
        uint256 a,
        uint256 b,
        uint256 denominator
    ) internal pure returns (uint256 result) {
        // 512-bit multiply [prod1 prod0] = a * b
        // Compute the product mod 2**256 and mod 2**256 - 1
        // then use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to reconstruct
        // the 512 bit result. The result is stored in two 256
        // variables such that product = prod1 * 2**256 + prod0
        uint256 prod0; // Least significant 256 bits of the product
        uint256 prod1; // Most significant 256 bits of the product
        assembly {
            let mm := mulmod(a, b, not(0))
            prod0 := mul(a, b)
            prod1 := sub(sub(mm, prod0), lt(mm, prod0))
        }

        // Handle non-overflow cases, 256 by 256 division
        if (prod1 == 0) {
            require(denominator > 0);
            assembly {
                result := div(prod0, denominator)
            }
            return result;
        }

## Recommendation
consider calculations that can cause overflow/underflow in uint256 require rigorous validation and updating to the latest version to reduce some gas <a href="https://xn--2-umb.com/21/muldiv/">Mathemagic finale: muldiv</a>
