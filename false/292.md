# USE CALL() INSTEAD OF TRANSFER() ON AN ADDRESS PAYABLE

## Summary
USE CALL() INSTEAD OF TRANSFER() ON AN ADDRESS PAYABLE
## Vulnerability Detail
When transferring ETH, use call() instead of transfer().

The transfer() function only allows the recipient to use 2300 gas. If the recipient uses more than that, transfers will fail. In the future gas costs might change increasing the likelihood of that happening.

Keep in mind that call() introduces the risk of reentrancy. But, as long as the router follows the checks effects interactions pattern it should be fine. Itâ€™s not supposed to hold any tokens anyway.

Whenever the user either fails to implement the payable fallback function or cumulative gas cost of the function sequence invoked on a native token transfer exceAdditionally, using higher than 2300 gas might be mandatory for some multisig wallets.
