# call() should be used instead of transferfrom() on an address payable

## Summary
`call()` should be used instead of `transferfrom()` on an address payable

## Vulnerability Detail

        collateral.transferFrom(

## Impact
Use call instead of transfer to send ether. And return value must be checked if sending ether is successful or not.
Sending ether with the transfer is no longer recommended.

Example:
The use of the deprecated transferfrom() function for an address will inevitably make the transaction fail when:

The claimer smart contract does not implement a payable function.
The claimer smart contract does implement a payable fallback which uses more than 2300 gas unit.
The claimer smart contract implements a payable fallback function that needs less than 2300 gas units but is called through proxy, raising the call's gas usage above 2300.
Additionally, using higher than 2300 gas might be mandatory for some multisig wallets.
