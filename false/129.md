# Unregistering depository may be unsafe

## Summary
Unregistering a depository may be unsafe for existing depositors.

## Vulnerability Detail
In UXDRouter.sol, the owner can call `unregisterDepository` to remove an existing depository. This is fine for an empty depository, but would be an issue for existing ones with assets deposited. 
For example, consider two existing repositories: PerpDepository and RageDnDepository
1. A user deposits collateral into a PerpDepository
2. The owner removes the PerpDepository, and the RageDnDepository becomes the depository for redemptions
3. The user attempts to redeem from RageDnDepository.

## Impact
Medium - This results in the wrong Depository being used for withdrawals.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Revert if the target depository has assets.
