# __gap missing in upgradeable contracts

## Summary
Storage gaps are a convention for reserving storage slots in a base contract, allowing future versions of that contract to use up those slots without affecting the storage layout of child contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

The contracts ```UXDController```, ```RageDnDepository```, ```PerpDepository``` do not contain a ```__gap``` variable although they are upgradeable.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding a correct ```__gap``` variable to these contracts, or documenting a plan for managing storage collisions when upgrading ```UXDController```, ```RageDnDepository```, ```PerpDepository```.  Implementing this will reduce the surface for error and in the long run may save developer time by removing confusion about the storage layout of the contracts.

```solidity
  // Storage gap for future potential upgrades
  uint256[100] private __gap;
```
