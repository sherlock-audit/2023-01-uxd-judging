# There no use of safeMint() as safe guard for users

## Summary
There no use of safeMint() as safe guard for users

## Vulnerability Detail
At https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDToken.sol#L75
    function mint(address account, uint256 amount) external onlyController {
        localMintAmount += amount;
        _checkLocalMint();
        _mint(account, amount);
        emit Minted(account, amount);
    }

## Impact
Example:
Calling mint this way does not ensure that the receiver of the NFT is able to accept them. _safeMint() should be used with reentrancy guards as a guard to protect the user as it checks to see if a user can properly accept an NFT and reverts otherwise.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function mint(address account, uint256 amount) external onlyController {
        localMintAmount += amount;
        _checkLocalMint();
        _mint(account, amount);
        emit Minted(account, amount);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`"_safeMint"` performs some important safety checks or critical functionality that is necessary for the proper functioning of the mint function, then not using `"_safeMint"` could potentially make the mint function unsafe to use. On the other hand, if `"_safeMint"` is simply a helper function that is not essential for the correct operation of the mint function.
