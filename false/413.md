# The `_abs` function in the `PerpDepository.sol` is useless since there are no negative numbers in Solidity

## Summary
In solidity we have only unsigned integers which means we can't have negative numbers, there is no reason to convert a number to it's "Absolute" version, since it could either be 0 or greater than 0, it can't be negative (-).

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_abs` function in `PerpDepository.sol` is supposed to return the "absolute" value of a number. It's useless and doesn't make sense because we don't have negative numbers in solidity.
In case the input number is 0 it returns uint256(-1 * value), which will revert since you can't use negative numbers in solidity.
`_abs` is used in multiple places in the contract, which wastes a lot of gas, in addition if the value that will be sent to the function will be 0, it will be reverted due to the usage of -1.
`_abs(0)` ==> always reverts.

## Impact
Dos for the contract when `_abs(0)`, and a lot of wasted gas anytime we call this function.
