# Protocol redeems more ETH than it should due to a logic bug

## Summary
The `redeemForEth` function in the `UXDController.sol` contract has a bug which sends the user twice amount of the ETH that he is supposed to get

## Vulnerability Detail
If a user wishes to redeem his UXD token for ETH, he will call the `redeemForEth` function.

The `redeemForEth` function first calls the internal `_redeem` function which will send WETH to the user based on the amountOut.

The same amount will be converted to ETH again and sent back to the user as native ETH using the `.call` opcode.

A malicious attacker can deposit X ETH using the "mintWithEth" function, then redeem it using the "redeemForEth" function and receive X WETH + X ETH which is 2 ETH.

In mint: deposit => 1 ETH, In redeem: receive => 2 ETH 

By doing so, an attacker can easily drain the protocol's ETH reserves.

## Impact
Draining the WETH reserves of the protocol.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Don't send both WETH and ETH to the user.
In the internal `_redeem` function, a check should be added to make sure the user does not gets the token if it is WETH
