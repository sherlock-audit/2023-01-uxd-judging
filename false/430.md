# Unhandled Return Values of transfer and transferFrom

## Summary
Unsafe `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions are used in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
There are functions in which ERC20 token transfer and tranferFrom is not checking the return values.
Since some of the ERC20 tokens does not revert on failure but return false instead, 
it is important to check the return values or otherwise these tokens is still counted as a correct transfer
even thought it didn't actually perform the transfer.

## Impact
Function execution will not revert for certain tokens even though the ERC20 transfer failed which will cause loss of funds for protocol and user.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend to add a require() statement that checks the return values or use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 wrapper functions.
