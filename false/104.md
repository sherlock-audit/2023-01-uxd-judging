# Missing check to ensure the collateral transfer went through.

## Summary
Missing check to ensure the collateral transfer went through.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the function `mint()`, the asset tokens are transferred from the msg.sender to the depository. 
But there is no check to ensure the transfer was successful and went through.
This will be problematic considering there are some tokens, which don't return boolean value on transfer.

As you can see a check is rightly applied in the other function `mintWithEth()`, but it is missing in `mint()`.

## Impact
Missed check in one of the core functions to ensure the token transfer was successful.
