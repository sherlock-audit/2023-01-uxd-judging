# function RageDnDepository:deposit, redeem are not so safe without controller approval

## Summary
function RageDnDepository::deposit, redeem mechanism to control the access and can be abused by attackers

## Vulnerability Detail
because there is no mechanism to control the access rights of the user different from the controller, the attacker can deposit, redeem without the consent of the controller and the amount of assets allowed to withdraw, the amount of assets that can be done by the user, the attacker can get the amount of assets that he should not be able to. the attacker can generate a non-withdrawable amount. the attacker can redeem the amount that was not supposed to be withdrawn and cause unwanted things to happen

## Impact
RageDnDepository.sol#L99
Bob and Alice can deposit assets that they shouldn't be able to, such as depositing assets in amounts that shouldn't be possible such as price manipulation As a result, the future user who deposits 19999e18 will only receive 1 wei (from 19999e18 * 1 / 10000e18) of shares token. `getDepositoryAssets` , `getDepositoryShares()` and `assetsDeposited()`

    function deposit(address asset, uint256 assetAmount)

        returns (uint256)
    {
        if (asset != assetToken) {
            revert UnsupportedAsset(asset);
        }
        netAssetDeposits += assetAmount;
        IERC20(assetToken).approve(address(vault), assetAmount);
        uint256 shares = vault.deposit(assetAmount, address(this));
        uint256 redeemableAmount = _assetsToRedeemable(assetAmount);
        redeemableUnderManagement += redeemableAmount;
        _checkSoftCap();
        emit Deposited(msg.sender, assetAmount, redeemableAmount, shares);
        return redeemableAmount;
    }
```
RageDnDepository.sol#L120
can withdraw a redeemable amount that should not be withdrawn
``` solidity
    function redeem(address asset, uint256 redeemableAmount)
        external
        onlyController
        returns (uint256)
    {
        if (asset != assetToken) {
            revert UnsupportedAsset(asset);
        }
        uint256 assetAmount = _redeemableToAssets(redeemableAmount);
        redeemableUnderManagement -= redeemableAmount;
        netAssetDeposits -= assetAmount;
        uint256 shares = vault.withdraw(
            assetAmount,
            address(controller),
            address(this)
        );
        emit Withdrawn(msg.sender, assetAmount, redeemableAmount, shares);
        return assetAmount;
    }
