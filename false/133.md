    function forceResumeReceive(uint16 _srcChainId, bytes calldata _srcAddress) external override onlyOwner {
        lzEndpoint.forceResumeReceive(_srcChainId, _srcAddress);
    }

## Impact
 the `forceResumeReceive` function, the `onlyOwner` modifier ensures that only the owner of the contract can force the contract to resume receiving tokens. This can be a useful security measure to prevent unauthorized parties from forcing the contract to receive tokens, which could potentially lead to financial loss.

However, if the owner of the contract is compromised or acts maliciously, they could use the `forceResumeReceive` function to force the contract to receive tokens from an unauthorized source, potentially leading to financial loss.

## Code Snippet
`    function forceResumeReceive(uint16 _srcChainId, bytes calldata _srcAddress) external override onlyOwner {`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set a multisig as the owner and use a timelock.
