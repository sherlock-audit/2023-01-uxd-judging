# Rage trade only support in arbitrum, Perp Protocol will only support optimism, no depository support on Ethereum mainnet

## Summary

Rage trade only support in arbitrum, Perp Protocol will only support optimism, no depository support on Ethereum

## Vulnerability Detail

According to the onchain context of the README.

```solidity
DEPLOYMENT: mainnet, arbitrum, optimism
ERC20: USDC, WETH
ERC721: none
ERC777: none
FEE-ON-TRANSFER: none
REBASING TOKENS: none
ADMIN: trusted
```

The protocol is intended to support ethereum mainnet, arbitrum and optimism

However, the integrated depository is with Rage trade, which heavily relies on GMX, and GMX support avalanche and arbitrum,Rage trade only support arbitrum network.

Perp procotol, on the other hand, only support optimism,

None of the depository support ethereum mainnet.

So the deployment on mainnet may fail, the Rage trade depository does not work in optimism and the perp prepetual opening position code does not work in arbitrum.

## Impact

Lack of support and violation of on-chain context.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol integrate with a protocol that support ethereum mainnet or modify the on-chain context documentation.
