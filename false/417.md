Low-level transfers made using the call() function can fail silently

## Impact


As stated in the Solidity documentation, check here, https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions.  The call, delegatecall and staticcall functions can return true even when the account being called does not exist. This is a feature of the EVM. 

To avoid silent failures, it is important to check for the existence of the account before making a transfer.
