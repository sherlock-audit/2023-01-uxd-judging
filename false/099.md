# [Meduim] Did Not Approve To Zero First Causing Certain Token Transfer To Fail

## Summary
Some tokens (like USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. For example Tether (USDT)'s approve() function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals. in the PerpDepository contract to deposit tokens to Perpetual protocol code uses `ERC20.approve()` and then call `Vault.deposit()`, if there are some allowance dust left then the `ERC20.approve()` would fail for some tokens. as the spending amount is decided by Perpetual protocol, so the 3rd party protocol can spend and transfer a little less amount (in the future updates or currently) which would cause deposits logics to fail.

## Vulnerability Detail
This is `_depositAsset()` and `depositInsurance()` code in PerpDepository:
```
    function depositInsurance(uint256 amount, address from)
        external
        nonReentrant
        onlyOwner
    {
        if (amount == 0) {
            revert ZeroAmount();
        }
        uint256 allowance = IERC20(insuranceToken()).allowance(
            from,
            address(this)
        );
        if (allowance < amount) {
            revert NotApproved(allowance, amount);
        }

        insuranceDeposited += amount;

        IERC20(insuranceToken()).transferFrom(from, address(this), amount);
        IERC20(insuranceToken()).approve(address(vault), amount);
        vault.deposit(insuranceToken(), amount);

        emit InsuranceDeposited(msg.sender, from, amount);
    }
    
    function _depositAsset(uint256 amount) private {
        netAssetDeposits += amount;

        IERC20(assetToken).approve(address(vault), amount);
        vault.deposit(assetToken, amount);
    }    
```
As you can see to deposit tokens into 3rd party Vault, code calls `approve(, amount)` without setting allowance to 0 first, this would revert for some of the tokens if there were some allowance left from past. because Vault is for another protocol so the exact spending amount can change by updates or because the 3rd party protocol is paused the function just return false... so if by any reason some dust allowance left then the protocol won't work after that.

## Impact
deposit logics would be broken for some tokens.

## Recommendation
call `approve(,0)` first then `approve(,amount)`
