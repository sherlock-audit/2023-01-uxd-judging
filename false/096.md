# [High] Code doesn't support non-standard ERC20 tokens like USDT, this can cause fund loss for users or protocol

## Summary
to interact with ERC20 tokens code don't use OZ SafeERC20 standard library and because some of the ERC20 tokens doesn't return any value when interacting with them so the function calls would revert because of this. this would happen for transfer and approve. ERC20 standard allows transfer function of some contracts to return bool or return nothing. Some tokens such as USDT return nothing. This could lead to funds stuck in the contract without possibility to retrieve them. Using safeTransferFrom of SafeERC20.sol is recommended instead. Some other tokens return false in case of failure and code doesn't check the return value of the calls to ERC20 and code would assume operations were successful even so they were not. right now there is no check for return value of the function calls to ERC20 tokens in most cases.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/4a9cc8b4918ef3736229a5cc5a310bdc17bf759f/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol

## Impact
Tokens that return void, like USDT, will be unusable in the protocol as they revert the transaction because of the missing return value. tokens that return false when the operation fails can cause fund loss for protocol or other users(code would assumes transfers were successful while they weren't).
