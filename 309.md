# Users unable to withdraw asset if asset is removed

## Summary
Users unable to withdraw asset if asset is removed

## Vulnerability Detail
The _removeAsset function in UXDController.sol does not check if there are any assets in the valut before the asset can be removed. This results in users being unable to withdraw their assets if this function was called while their assets are still in the valut. 

## Impact
Users unable to withdraw their assets.

## Tool used

## Recommendation
Include a check to ensure there are no more of such assets before the _removeAsset function can be executed.
