# UXDController._redeem and mint incompatible with tokens like ZRX, HT and WOO. Alternatively, incompatible with USDT

## Summary
Contract uses tranfer() and transferFrom() without checking the return value. 

## Vulnerability Detail
When using e.g. transferFrom() with tokens like ZRX, if the transactions fails it simply returns a false bool. Meaning the function completes without having the tokens transferred. 
## Impact
Protocol might not receive assets when using .mint or user might not receive assets when using .redeem.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom from OZ. Do note that implementing a require will make the contract incompatible with USDT since it does not return a value at all. That would mean that the require statement will always fail.
