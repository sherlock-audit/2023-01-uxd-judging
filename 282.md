# Attacker can DOS redeem and mint UXD by using `localMintAmount` variable.

## Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDToken.sol#L84

## Vulnerability Detail
In `UXDToken` contract, variables `localMintAmount` and `localMintCap` are used to limit amount of UXD can be minted on specific network/chain.

However, `localMintAmount` did not accounted for UXD transferred in from other chain. As we can see, in function `_creditTo()` and `_debitFrom()`
```solidity
function _debitFrom(address _from, uint16, bytes memory, uint _amount) internal virtual override returns(uint) {
    address spender = _msgSender();
    if (_from != spender) _spendAllowance(_from, spender, _amount);
    _burn(_from, _amount);
    return _amount;
}

function _creditTo(uint16, address _toAddress, uint _amount) internal virtual override returns(uint) {
    _mint(_toAddress, _amount);
    return _amount;
}
```

As the result, function `UXDToken.burn()` can fail because of overflow and users cannot redeem on a specific chain. 

## Impact
Users cannot redeem UXD on local chain but have to transfer it to another chain to redeem.

Consider the scenario
1. Attacker mint `UXD` on Optimism and transfer it to Arbitrum
2. Attacker burn `UXD` on Arbitrum then transfer funds back to Optimism
3. Repeat step 1 and 2

### Result
* On Optimism, `localMintAmount` is always equal to `localMintCap` and no one can mint
* On Arbitrum, `localMintAmount` is always equal to `0` and no one can burn.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function burn(address account, uint256 amount) external onlyController {
    localMintAmount -= amount; 
    // @audit it could be token from other chain
    if (account != msg.sender) {
        _spendAllowance(account, msg.sender, amount);
    }
    _burn(account, amount);
    emit Burned(account, amount);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider reviewing the design for `localMintAmount`.
