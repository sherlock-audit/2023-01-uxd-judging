# Get an unintended depository

## Summary
```unregisterDepository()``` to remove the depository will disrupt the order of the array, resulting in ```findDepositoryForDeposit()``` may get an unintended depository

## Vulnerability Detail

We add the depository by registerDepository(), each assetToken corresponds to a depository array:```address[] depositories```
Then we pass the assetToken through ```findDepositoryForDeposit()``` to get the current depository, since one assetToken corresponds to one depository array, the algorithm currently used is to take the earliest registered depository, i.e. depositories[0].
so the order of the depository array is very important. We expect to take it from the earliest first and the others are alternative.

The other important function ```unregisterDepository()``` performs the removal of the depository from the array if it is no longer valid.
The removal is done by using the common swap way with the last one in the array.
Example.
The original array is :
[0] = depository_0
[1] = depository_1
[2] = depository_2
After removing depository_0 (depository_2 will be moved to [0])
the array becomes:
[0] = depository_2
[1] = depository_1

This messes up the order, findDepositoryForDeposit() will get depository_2, but it should be depository_1 as normally expected


Disrupting the order will result in get an unintended depository, and current depository  plays a very important role in UXDController

I think it is better to keep the original order, so I suggest to move the whole subarray up when removing, so as to keep the original order

## Recommendation
move the whole subarray up when removing ï¼Œ Keeping the order
```solidity
    function unregisterDepository(address depository, address assetToken)
        external
        onlyOwner
    {
...
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < byAsset.length; i++) {
            if (byAsset[i] == depository) {
                foundByAsset = true;
-               byAsset[i] = byAsset[byAsset.length - 1];
+               if (i != byAsset.length - 1) { //not last , move up 
+                   for (uint256 j = i; j < byAsset.length - 1; j++) {
+                       byAsset[j] = byAsset[j+1];
+                   }
+               }
                byAsset.pop();
                break;
            }
