# Uncertainty while choosing depository

## Summary
Uncertainty while choosing depository

## Vulnerability Detail

There are 2 bad things:
1. ``_depositoriesForAsset[token]`` is an array, not one address. And it's not obviously which one of the array addresses will be used as depository if you don't read the code
Actually, only first address will be used, so it's useless to keep an array
2. If owner deletes address from ``_depositoriesForAsset[token]`` array, after that probably will be user not the second one, but the last one
For example: ``_depositoriesForAsset[token] = [A, B, C]``
So now actual depository is A
Owner deletes A and wants B to become a real depository
But because of delete logic C will become a real depository and ``_depositoriesForAsset[token] = [C, B]``

## Impact

Transfer funds to wrong and not obvious depositories

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Make a ``_depositoriesForAsset[token]`` just an address, not a token
So it will be like:
```solidity
mapping(address => address) private _depositoriesForAsset;
```
