# Users cannot redeem assets if the first depository is out of funds, even if other depositories have enough tokens

## Summary

Users cannot redeem assets if the first depository is out of funds, even if other depositories have enough tokens. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `UXDController._redeem` calls the `UXDRouter` to get a repository with the user-requested [`assetToken` parameter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDController.sol#L323-L331), which [finds the first element](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDRouter.sol#L89-L91) in the `_depositoriesForAsset[assetToken]` state variable array that has that asset. 

If that depository does not have enough funds, the `IDepository(depository).redeem` call will revert. 

It may be the case that, for the same `assetToken`, the first element of the `UXDRouter._depositoriesForAsset` does not have enough funds, while the second has. 

In this case, the `UXDRouter` might be solvent, but the user might not be able to redeem their assets.

## Impact

Users are unable to redeem their assets

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDRouter.sol#L89-L95
```diff
    function findDepositoryForDeposit(address assetToken, uint256) external view returns (address) {
        return _firstDepositoryForAsset(assetToken);
    }

    function findDepositoryForRedeem(address assetToken, uint256) external view returns (address) {
        return _firstDepositoryForAsset(assetToken);
    }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

If a user is trying to redeem their assets, loop through all depositories until users can redeem all their funds, instead of only checking the first one from the array.
