# Only one depository can be used per `assetToken`

## Summary

The `UXDRouter` always returns the first registered depository for an `assetToken` using `_firstDepositoryForAsset()`. This means that other depositories registered for that `assetToken` will never be reached.
 
## Vulnerability Detail

Consider a case where `WETH` is registered as an assetToken and multiple depositories are added for it.
Only the first depository added will ever be used.

```solidity
    function _firstDepositoryForAsset(address assetToken) internal view returns (address) {
       address[] storage depositories = _depositoriesForAsset[assetToken];
        if (depositories.length == 0) {
            revert NotExists(assetToken);
        }
        return depositories[0]; 
    }
```

This in effect means there can only be one depository used per assetToken which is against the protocol design intentions.

To add to the complication, when the soft cap for a depository is reached, the transaction will just revert meaning the other depositories will not be used even then.

## Impact

This will break the protocol functionality and heavily over rely on single depositories per `assetToken`. The only way to use another depository for the assetToken would be to unregister the first one which may not be feasible.

## Recommendation

One recommendation would be to route a transaction to another depository if the soft cap of the first depository is reached. Alternatively level of utilization of depositories could be used to determine routing logic instead of just using the first depository.
