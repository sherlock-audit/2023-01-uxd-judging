# Hard to change the positions of registered depositors

## Summary

In `UXDRouter`, only the first registered depositor in `_depositoriesForAsset` is used. And It is hard to change the positions of registered depositors. If the owner wants to abandon the first registered depositor and use another depositor. The owner can not directly change the positions.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function unregisterDepository(address depository, address assetToken)
        external
        onlyOwner
    {
        bool foundByAsset = false;
        address[] storage byAsset = _depositoriesForAsset[assetToken];
        if (byAsset.length == 0) {
            revert NotExists(assetToken);
        }
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < byAsset.length; i++) {
            if (byAsset[i] == depository) {
                foundByAsset = true;
                byAsset[i] = byAsset[byAsset.length - 1];
                byAsset.pop();
                break;
            }
        }
        if (!foundByAsset) {
            revert NotExists(assetToken);
        }

        emit DepositoryUnregistered(assetToken, depository);
    }

```


If the number of the registered depositors is 10 and the owner wants to use the 5th registered depositor instead of the first depositor. The owner has to take the following step
* unregistered 5th depositor
* registered 5th depositor back (Move 5th depositor to the last position)
* unregistered 1st depositor (Move the last depositor to the first position)

## Impact

It is hard for the owner to choose the desired depositors from ` _depositoriesForAsset`.
