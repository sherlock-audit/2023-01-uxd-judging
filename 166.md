# Casting overflow risk

## Summary

Casting is not protected from overflows or underflows like simple math operations with addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. There is a small risk of a casting overflow in UXD.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [return value from `getPositionValue`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L712) in PerpDepository is approximately 2\*\*140 if the price is a reasonable $1000 with a position size of 1E21 (1E3 with decimals of 18). A higher price or larger position size will result in a larger return value. This value [is cast to a int256 value in `getUnrealizedPnl`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L430). If the value cast to a int256 is greater than 2\*\*255, then the value large uint256 value would be turned into a very large negative value, because 2\*\*255 -1 is the largest position value that can be stored in a int256 variable. In order to reach such a high value, the price and position size of the `getPositionValue` calculation would have to increase by 10\*\*35. While a large number, it is not impossible that this increase could be reached in the future if ETH prices rise.

## Impact

An overflow would result in one or more functions in PerpDepository returning incorrect values

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a check [like what is in SafeCast](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/d59306bd06a241083841c2e4a39db08e1f3722cc/contracts/utils/math/SafeCast.sol#L1131) to prevent overflow
```solidity
require(value <= uint256(type(int256).max)
```
