# Bypass local mint cap for UXDToken

## Summary
Only a certain amount of UXDToken should be minted on a specific chain.
This amount is specified by the `localMintCap`: 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDToken.sol#L45

The issue is that the `localMintCap` is not checked when receiving UXDToken cross-chain via the LayerZero protocol.

This means that by minting UXDToken on one chain, say Arbitrum, and then sending it to another chain, say Optimism, one can bypass the `localMintCap` on Optimism.

## Vulnerability Detail
Receiving UXDToken from another chain via the LayerZero protcol executes the `OFT._creditTo` function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/external/layer-zero/token/oft/OFT.sol#L33-L36

You can see that this function mints UXDToken without checking the `localMintCap`.

## Impact
The `localMintCap` can be bypassed which allows for more UXDToken to exist on a chain than should be possible.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Override the `_creditTo` function in the `UXDToken` contract and increase `localMintAmount` by the amount to mint, then check that the `localMintCap` is not exceeded.

Override the `_debitFrom` function in the `UXDToken` contract and decrease `localMintAmount` by the amount to burn.
