# Rage share price change could prevent users to redeem their `UXD` for `USDC`

## Summary

The price change of the Rage vault share could prevent users to be able to redeem their `UXD` for the amount of `USDC` they have previously deposited

## Vulnerability Detail

There are two flows that the user can follow by interacting with the `UXDController`

### Flow 1: mint `UXD`

1) Alice call `mint` on `UXDController` sending `amountX` amount of `USDC`
2) `UXDController` ask `UXDRouter` which is the correct `Depository` to use for the `asset` (`USDC` in this case)
3) In our case, it selects `RageDnDepository` and call `deposit`. The `UXDController` mints `amountOut` `UXD` with `amountOut` being the result of `depository.deposit(...)`. Note that `amountOut` is NOT the number of shares minted by the Rage Vault.
4) Internally, the `RageDnDepository` deposits those USDC into the Rage vault that will mint `amountY` of `RageShareUSDC` based on the calculation done by `previewDeposit(assets)` that will calculate the number of shares to mint based on the amount of underlying deposited

At this point, Alice will own `amountX` of `UXD` (1:1 with the `amountX` of `USDC` deposited to the `UXDController`) and the `RageOnDepository` will own `amountY` of `RageShareUSDC`. 

**Note that there's not a specific 1:1 link between the number of shares and the number of USDC deposited to the vault**

### Flow 2: redeem the `amountX` of `UXD` minted before

1) Alice call `redeem` on `UXDController` sending `amountX` amount of `USDC`
2) `UXDController` ask `UXDRouter` which is the correct `Depository` to use for the `asset` (`USDC` in this case)
3) In our case, it selects `RageDnDepository` and call `redeem`. The `UXDController` burn `amountOut` `UXD` with `amountOut` being the result of `depository.deposit(...)`. Note that `amountOut` is NOT the number of shares burned by the Rage Vault.
4) Internally, the `RageDnDepository` call `vault.withdraw(...)` that will burn `amountY` of `RageShareUSDC` shares with `amountY` calculated as `previewWithdraw(assets)` and if the burn operation does not revert (`RageDnDepository` owns enough shares) it will withdraw `amountX` of `USDC` to the `UXDController` that will burn `UXD` and transfer all back to `Alice`

Important note:
1) `UXDController` mint `amountX` (equal to the amount of `USDC` deposited by the user) of `UXD` independently by the number of shares minted by the `Rage Vault`
2)  all the `RageShareUSDC` are owned by the `RageDnDepository` without knowing how many shares are owned by a single user, everything is pooled together

#### Scenario

Let's assume that `RageShareUSDC` is 1:1 with `USDC` at `T0`
Let's assume that 10 users `user1` ... `user10` deposits `100 USDC` to `UXDController` and receive `100 UXD` each
Let's assume that `Alice` deposits `500 USDC`  to `UXDController` and receive `500 UXD`

After this Alice owns `500 UXD`, other users own `100 UXD`, `RageDnDepository` owns `1500 RageShareUSDC` shares

At `T1` the value of `RageShareUSDC` decrease and now `1 USDC == 2 RageShareUSDC`
`Alice` `redeem` her `500 UXD`. By doing that, the `RageVault` will burn `1000 RageShareUSDC` owned by the `RageDnDepository` and send `500 USDC` to the `UXDController` that will burn `500 UXD` of Alice and transfer the USDC back to `Alice`

After the operation, `RageDnDepository` only owns `500 RageShareUSDC` worth `250 USDC` but the other users still own `1000 UXD` in total. This mean that if all the users try to redeem their `UXD` they will not be able to redeem all of them.

## Impact

Users that have deposited `USDC` and now owns `UXD` could not be able to redeem their `UXD` to get back `USDC`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

If this is the intended behavior, the users should be warned that even if their `1 USDC` are worth `1 UXD` it could happen that they would not be able to redeem all their `UXD` from the `Rage` depository if the Rage Vault share value decrease.

Otherwise, `UXD` should think to implement some kind of insurance to allow users to still be able to redeem all their `UXD`.
