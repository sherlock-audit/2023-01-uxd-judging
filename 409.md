# Significant divergence in unrealizedPnL calculation of Perp protocol vs Depository can lead to undercollateralization

## Summary
During high volatility period (as experienced in last 4 trading sessions from 11 Jan to 15 Jan), unrealized P/L calculations in PerpDepository contract cannot keep up with the unrealized P/L changes in the Perp protocol. While the former uses a simplistic formula involving time-weighted average price, latter is actual reflection of liquidity v/s taker demand. `rebalance` and `rebalanceLite` functions for negative P/L use the `unrealizedPnL` function of `Perp` protocol to limit the amount of rebalancing. When there is a large divergence of unrealized PnL on Perp protocol, auto rebalancing does not allow for full rebalancing. In the extreme case, this can lead to margin breach  & asset (WETH) liquidation

## Vulnerability Detail
Unrealized P/L calculation in Depository uses redeemable UXD, current clearingHouse account balance & 15 block TWAP in [`getUnrealizedPnL` function in `PerpDepository` contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L430). Perp curie contracts, on the other hand, calculate unrealized P/L using the [`getPnlAndPendingFee` function in `AccountBalance` contract](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-contract/blob/27ea8e2c4be37d1dd58c1eed3b3cc269d398a091/contracts/AccountBalance.sol#L251).  

I have deployed the `Depository` on optimism goerli (0x3d5573e7f3a942bc8b508c3adb69acfb73f81835) on Jan 10'th - total position size of $40.86 UXD. Between 10'th and 15'th, $ETH rose by ~25%.  Volatility & Open Interest has increased significantly in 5 days. 

Unrealized P/L on Perp protocol is significantly higher than that calculated by depository contract (more than double).

## Impact

Proof of concept (all numbers are representation only)
- insurance fund is fully utilised
- Perp protocol margin is 1.5 million
- unrealized P/L on UXD protocol is -1 million
- unrealized P/L on Perp protocol is -1.8 million
- Bob calls `_rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap` function to the extent of -1 million (that's the limit that Bob can rebalance at the time)
- $ETH price increases further -> and unrealized P/L increases from -0.8 million to -1.5 million
- underlying WETH gets liquidated and $UXD becomes undercollateralized

In edge cases, the basis risk between both P/L computation methodologies can cause asset liquidation and under collateralization. Since this is a rare occurrence in specific market conditions, I've marked this risk as`Medium`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

On the negative rebalancing side, primary objective is to protect Perp position from Liquidiation. Recommend using `getUnrealizedPnL` of Perp protocol over the TWAP based `unrealizedPnL` computed by depository contract to regulate rebalancing amount. Most of the times, both numbers are close to each other - so it won't make much difference as to which methodology is used in calmer times

But, in the event of extremely high volatility where spot price can significantly be out-of-line compared to Perp price, funding rate might not be able to quickly stabilize the market - in such cases, `unrealizedPnL` of Perp protocol is what matters as the Perp protocol is adjusting to real-time supply-demand.
