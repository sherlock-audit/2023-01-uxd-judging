# PerpDepository: user can lose funds in _rebalanceNegativePnlLite function due to partial order execution

## Summary
The `PerpDepository._rebalanceNegativePnlLite` function is called internally by the `PerpDepository.rebalanceLite` function.

Due to partial order execution by specifying a `sqrtPriceLimitX96` parameter, the amount paid to the user in WETH might not match the amount of USDC withdrawn from the user, resulting in a loss for the user.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `PerpDepository.rebalanceLite` function takes a `sqrtPriceLimitX96` parameter.
This can be used for slippage protection to fill an order only until this limit price is reached.

The `PerpDepository.rebalanceLite` function performs 3 actions:
1. Transfer USDC from `account` into vault

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L626-L628

2. Close some amount of the short position (USDC -> WETH direction)

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L632-L637

3. Withdraw the WETH amount from step 2 from the vault and transfer it to `account`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L638-L639

The issue is that the order in step 2 can be executed partially such that the returned `baseAmount` of WETH does not match the USDC amount withdrawn from `account` in step 1.

E.g. the USDC amount withdrawn from `account` might be worth 0.1 ETH but due to partial order execution the `account` only receives 0.01 ETH.

This means a loss of funds for `account`.

## Impact
Loss of funds for `account` due to partial order execution.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either transfer back to `account` the difference between the amount deposited to the vault and the `quoteAmount` returned by the perp order.
Or do not allow the caller to specifiy `sqrtPriceLimitX96` and set it to zero such that there can be no partial order execution.
The order size should be small anyway so there is not much risk for slippage to occur.
