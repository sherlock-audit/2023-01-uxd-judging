# Unsafe ERC20 methods

## Summary
Using unsafe ERC20 methods can revert the transaction for certain tokens.
## Vulnerability Detail
Transfer()/TransferFrom function may not revert in case of failure for example there are many weird ERC20 token that won't work correctly using the standard IERC20 interface. So it's better to use SafeTransfer()/SafeTransferFrom() which will revert and may prevent loss of funds
## Impact
Contract won't work as it is intended to do
