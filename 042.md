# PerpDepository: _rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap function deposits USDC amount denominated in 1e18 to vault

## Summary
The `PerpDepository._rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap` function deposits the amount of USDC returned by the perp trade to the vault.

The amount returned by the perp trade is denominated in 1e18.

However the vault uses a regular USDC value which is denominated in 1e6.

Thereby if the perp trade returns a `quoteAmount` of 1e18 which is 1 USDC, the vault will deposit the same amount which is actually 1e12 USDC.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `quoteAmount` is returned by executing the perpetual trade:

It is denominated in 1e18.

This same amount is used to deposit USDC into the vault:

The vault however expects the amount to be denominated in 1e6.

## Impact
The vault deposits a wrong USDC amount which is too large by factor 1e12.
At best the function is unusable.
However if a user is not careful and approves the `PerpDepository` to transfer `type(uint256).max` thinking that the `PerpDepository` transfers the correct amount such that the user does not have to do any calculation, the user might have withdrawn an amount that is way too large.

A realistic scenario would be for the actual USDC amount to be very small, say 0.000001 USDC (1e-6). The actual amount deposited to the vault would then be `1e-6 * 1e12 = 1e6`. 1 million USDC is a realistic amount that is held in some addresses and this is the amount that is lost in this case.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Convert the `quoteAmount` to the right amount of decimals like this:

```solidity
vault.deposit(quoteToken, quoteAmount.fromDecimalToDecimal(18, ERC20(quoteToken).decimals()));
```
