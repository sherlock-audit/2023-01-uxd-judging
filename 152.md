# quoteToken has become un-redeemable permanently.

## Summary
quoteToken will become un-redeemable permanently.

## Vulnerability Detail
The redeem() function wants to redeem either two tokens 1.assetToken or 2.quoteToken but in this function only assetToken can be redeemed but not quoteToken due function call which redeem of qouteToken is commented and replaced by revert . If this is deployed then the quoteToken holder will bear the loss . In above comment of redeem() describe either two token will redeem but in function only one assetToken will get redeem .If user submit quoteToken it will revert the transactions.



## Impact
quoteToken will become un-redeemable permanently and users will bear the loss.
