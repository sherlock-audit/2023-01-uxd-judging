# `PerpDepositor.withdrawInsurance` should call vault.getFreeCollateral first

## Summary

When withdrawing collaterals from the perp vault, one can withdraw the amount up to its `freeCollateral`. So it should check the amount of `freeCollateral`before withdrawing in `PerpDepositor.withdrawInsurance`. Otherwise, it would revert due to (https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-contract/blob/main/contracts/Vault.sol#L677)

## Vulnerability Detail

`PerpDepositor.withdrawInsurance` is a simple function which withdraws insurance from the perp vault.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L208
```solidity
    function withdrawInsurance(uint256 amount, address to)
        external
        nonReentrant
        onlyOwner
    {
        if (amount == 0) {
            revert ZeroAmount();
        }

        insuranceDeposited -= amount;

        vault.withdraw(insuranceToken(), amount);
        IERC20(insuranceToken()).transfer(to, amount);

        emit InsuranceWithdrawn(msg.sender, to, amount);
    }
```

But the perp vault would check how much collateral the user can withdraw. It would revert if the `amount` is higher than the amount of free collateral.
https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-contract/blob/main/contracts/Vault.sol#L677
```solidity
    function withdraw(address token, uint256 amount)
        external
        override
        whenNotPaused
        nonReentrant
        onlySettlementOrCollateralToken(token)
    {
        // input requirement checks:
        //   token: here
        //   amount: in _settleAndDecreaseBalance()

        address to = _msgSender();
        _withdraw(to, token, amount);
    }

    function _settleAndDecreaseBalance(
        address to,
        address token,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal {
        …
        uint256 freeCollateral = getFreeCollateralByToken(to, token);
        // V_NEFC: not enough freeCollateral
        require(freeCollateral >= amount, "V_NEFC");

       …
    }
```

## Impact

`PerpDepositor.withdrawInsurance` can only be called by the owner. Which means that It would be called through governance proposals. From creation to execution, a proposal takes some time. If a governance proposal has been created, voted on and passed by a community vote, it should be executed as desired.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Call `vault.getFreeCollateral()` before `vault.withdraw(insuranceToken(), amount)` to check how much collateral it can withdraw. 

If UXD wants to withdraw the insurance as much as possible. the function could be modified like the following: 

```solidity
    function withdrawInsurance(uint256 amount, address to)
        external
        nonReentrant
        onlyOwner
    {
        if (amount == 0) {
            revert ZeroAmount();
        }
        uint256 freeCollateral = vault.getFreeCollateral(address(this));
        uint256 newAmount = amount > freeCollateral  ? freeCollateral : amount; 
        insuranceDeposited -= newAmount;

        vault.withdraw(insuranceToken(), newAmount);
        IERC20(insuranceToken()).transfer(to, newAmount);

        emit InsuranceWithdrawn(msg.sender, to, newAmount);
    }
```
