# TWAP value is not reliable

## Summary
15 seconds of TWAP is not reliable enough to fetch the correct price.

## Vulnerability Detail
When calculating the unrealized Pnl, it queries the position value, and the protocol has a hardcoded value of 15 seconds for TWAP:
```solidity
    function getPositionValue() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 markPrice = getMarkPriceTwap(15);
    ...
```
The TWAP period is expressed in seconds. I believe 15 seconds of TWAP is too short and might be subject to manipulation. It is almost like getting the spot price directly.

By the way, the Perpetual protocol returns the spot price for  twapInterval < 10 seconds:
        _/// @dev if twapInterval < 10 (should be less than 1 block), return mark price without twap directly,
        ///      as twapInterval is too short and makes getting twap over such a short period meaningless_

## Impact
When the value of TWAP is so small, it makes it easier for an attacker to manipulate and keep the price for some time. In this case, 15 seconds mean usually a few blocks interval.

All the functions that rely on ```_checkNegativePnl``` could be bypassed: ```_processQuoteMint```, ```_rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap```, ```_rebalanceNegativePnlLite```.

This value is not configurable and cannot be updated in case a manipulation is noticed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Should use a reasonable default value, e.g. 15 minutes, but it could also be configurable so an admin can update it in case a manipulation is noticed.
