# Calculating the Perp short position value uses a potentially unsafe TWAP interval

## Summary

Calculating the Perp short position value with the `PerpDepository.getPositionValue` function uses a TWAP interval of 15 **seconds**. This is potentially unsafe and deviates from the **15 minutes** TWAP used by the Perp protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

Calculating the unrealized Pnl from the delta neutral position requires calculating the short position value. The short position value is calculated by multiplying the market price `markPrice` with the absolute value of the short position size `positionSize`. `markPrice` is internally calculated via the Uniswap V3 `getSqrtMarkTwapX96` (`IExchange` acts as a wrapper, [see here](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-contract/blob/27ea8e2c4be37d1dd58c1eed3b3cc269d398a091/contracts/Exchange.sol#L377-L379)) function using a TWAP interval of 15 **seconds** (could be accidentally and the author intended to use 15 **minutes**).

Longer TWAP intervals are more resilient to potential attackers or extremely volatile price changes. The tradeoff of longer intervals is that prices are less "fresh" - meaning that the current spot price can be a bit different from the average weighted price over 5 minutes if the price continuously changes during that time frame.

## Impact

Calculating the short position value with a TWAP interval of **15 seconds** is susceptible to market price manipulation and deviates from the **15 minutes** TWAP ([see here](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-contract/blob/27ea8e2c4be37d1dd58c1eed3b3cc269d398a091/contracts/ClearingHouseConfig.sol#L44) and [here](https://support.perp.com/hc/en-us/articles/5257580412569-Funding-Payments#heading-4)) used by the Perp protocol (potentially leading to incorrect states between the UXD and Perp protocol).

## Recommendation

Consider using `15 minutes` as the TWAP interval.
