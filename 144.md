# Interface Sanity Check

## Summary
Unsafe interface interactions
When governance is involved with contract updates, extra work should be done to require that inputs pass sanity checks. In this case, both `updateRouter` and `setRedeemable` check to verify that the address is a contract, but not the correct contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
No interface verification, EIP-165 is done for either `updateRouter` or `setRedeemable`. Smart contracts lacking the necessary functionally could be added. 

## Impact
If an incorrect contract is added this will likely result in downtime due for certain functionality to transaction failures. `setRedeemable` is owned by a governor. Governance protocols often times have time lock constraints, meaning if an incorrect contract is added and realized immediately, it could still require time to update with the correct value.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/IERC165.sol";

function updateRouter(address _router) external onlyOwner {
        require(IERC165(_router).supportsInterface(type(IUXDRouter).interfaceId), "UXDController::updateRouter: _router does not support IUXDRouter");

        router = IUXDRouter(_router);
        emit RouterUpdated(msg.sender, _router);
    }

    /// @notice Sets the redeemable token address
    /// @dev Can only be called by governor
    /// @param _redeemable The redeemable token address
    function setRedeemable(address _redeemable) external onlyOwner {
        require(IERC165(_redeemable).supportsInterface(type(IRedeemable).interfaceId), "UXDController::setRedeemable: _redeemable does not support IRedeemable");
        redeemable = IRedeemable(_redeemable);
    }
```

Replace the `!_router.isContract()` and `!_redeemable.isContract()` checks with EIP165 interface checks. Openzeppelin has contracts to handle this and will accomplish both situations simultaneously as non-smart contracts will not pass the checks.
