# `UXDRouter::unregisterDepository` does not implement critical safeguards

## Summary

The owner can unregister a depository that is still in use. This can have serious ramifications for the protcol functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `UXDRouter::unregisterDepository` can be called by the owner to unregister a depository irrespective of its current state.

```solidity
function unregisterDepository(address depository, address assetToken)
        external
        onlyOwner
    {
        bool foundByAsset = false;
        address[] storage byAsset = _depositoriesForAsset[assetToken];
        if (byAsset.length == 0) {
            revert NotExists(assetToken);
        }
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < byAsset.length; i++) {
            if (byAsset[i] == depository) {
                foundByAsset = true;
                byAsset[i] = byAsset[byAsset.length - 1];
                byAsset.pop();
                break;
            }
        }
        if (!foundByAsset) {
            revert NotExists(assetToken);
        }

        emit DepositoryUnregistered(assetToken, depository);
    }
```

This is dangerous as all user actions after that would fail or be directed to the second depository if one had been registered. An example would be a user trying to redeem their assets but being routed to the second depository which has just been initialized and doesn't have enough funds.

If there are more depositories registered for that assetToken, registering the unregistered depository would just move it to the end of the  `_depositoriesForAsset` array meaning it would still be inaccessible due to the nature of the UXDRouter's logic.

## Impact

Various functionality may become unavailable such as deposits and redemptions. Trying to fix the issue may compound the problem as registering the depository again later doesn't guarantee that it will be the one used.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Safeguards should be put in place where the state of a depository can be checked before it can be unregistered. Checks could include the net assets that the depository holds.
