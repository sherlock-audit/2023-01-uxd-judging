# Protocol can't migrate assets between depositories

## Summary
The protocol cannot migrate from one depository to another without a large coordinated endeavor involving all the UXD holders. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The only way for assets to be withdrawn from an external DEX is by redeeming UXD. Thus, if you want to migrate to a new depository, a UXD amount equivalent to the assets handled by the depository has to be redeemed. For that to happen you have to coordinate with all the UXD holders to redeem their tokens within a given timeframe. That way you withdraw all the assets before shutting down the depository.

Considering the inherent risk of DeFi protocols, especially newer ones which both [RageTrade](https://defillama.com/protocol/rage-trade) and [Perpetual](https://defillama.com/protocol/perpetual-protocol) are, there is a significant risk of there being an issue with them in the future. Having both the functionality and a plan in place to migrate and potentially save assets can prevent the protocol from blowing up.

## Impact
1. Blow up risk by one of the depositories having significant issues, e.g. a hack
2. opportunity costs if a better alternative comes to market

## Code Snippet
UXDRouter can unregister a depository (doesn't verify that all assets have been withdrawn): https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDRouter.sol#L59
```sol
    function unregisterDepository(address depository, address assetToken)
        external
        onlyOwner
    {
        bool foundByAsset = false;
        address[] storage byAsset = _depositoriesForAsset[assetToken];
        if (byAsset.length == 0) {
            revert NotExists(assetToken);
        }
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < byAsset.length; i++) {
            if (byAsset[i] == depository) {
                foundByAsset = true;
                byAsset[i] = byAsset[byAsset.length - 1];
                byAsset.pop();
                break;
            }
        }
        if (!foundByAsset) {
            revert NotExists(assetToken);
        }

        emit DepositoryUnregistered(assetToken, depository);
    }
```

The only function that allows the withdrawal of assets is through the `redeem()` function of the depository:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L264
```sol
    function redeem(
        address asset,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyController returns (uint256) {
        if (asset == assetToken) {
            (uint256 base, ) = _openLong(amount);
            _withdrawAsset(base, address(controller));
            return base;
        } else if (asset == quoteToken) {
            revert QuoteRedeemDisabled(msg.sender);
            // return _processQuoteRedeem(amount);
        } else {
            revert UnsupportedAsset(asset);
        }
    }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/rage-trade/RageDnDepository.sol#L120
```sol
    function redeem(address asset, uint256 redeemableAmount)
        external
        onlyController
        returns (uint256)
    {
        if (asset != assetToken) {
            revert UnsupportedAsset(asset);
        }
        uint256 assetAmount = _redeemableToAssets(redeemableAmount);
        redeemableUnderManagement -= redeemableAmount;
        netAssetDeposits -= assetAmount;
        uint256 shares = vault.withdraw(
            assetAmount,
            address(controller),
            address(this)
        );
        emit Withdrawn(msg.sender, assetAmount, redeemableAmount, shares);
        return assetAmount;
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There should be a concrete plan and functionality to migrate assets from one depository to another through a governance proposal.
