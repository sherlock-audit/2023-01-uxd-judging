# A depository for a given asset can be removed even if it still contains funds

## Summary

Each asset is bound to a list of depositories able to handle the asset. The depository retrieved in all functions is always the first one in the list so that the same depository is returned even if a new one is added to the list. However, it is possible to call `unregisterDepository` with parameters matching the first depository removing it from the list. And then the last depository is moved to the first position and always returned. However, some fund might have been transfered to the removed repository and those funds are not reedeemable anymore, at least up until the depository is added back to the list in the first position (in two operations: appending and swapping with a remove operation).

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

Some funds might be temporarily locked if the depository was holding funds and is removed from the router at some point.
