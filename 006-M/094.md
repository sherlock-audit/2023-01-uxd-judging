# Unregistering a depository that has open position can lock user's fund

## Summary

Unregistering a depository that has open position can lock user's fund

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation, when the user mint or redeem, it is via the UXDController, and the UXDController needs to locate the first available depository given an asset.

```solidity
address depository = router.findDepositoryForDeposit(assetToken, assetAmount);
```

the depository can be either perp protocol depository or the rage trade depository.

If the depository has user's fund, meaning the perp protocol depository has open position, or the rage trade depository holds the shares of the rage trade senior vault,

and the owner of the UXDRouter.sol unregister the depository, intentionally or unintentionally

```solidity
/// @notice Unregisters a previously registered depository
/// @param depository the depository address.
/// @param assetToken the asset to unregister depository for
function unregisterDepository(address depository, address assetToken)
	external
	onlyOwner
{
	bool foundByAsset = false;
	address[] storage byAsset = _depositoriesForAsset[assetToken];
	if (byAsset.length == 0) {
		revert NotExists(assetToken);
	}
	for (uint256 i = 0; i < byAsset.length; i++) {
		if (byAsset[i] == depository) {
			foundByAsset = true;
			byAsset[i] = byAsset[byAsset.length - 1];
			byAsset.pop();
			break;
		}
	}
	if (!foundByAsset) {
		revert NotExists(assetToken);
	}

	emit DepositoryUnregistered(assetToken, depository);
}
```

The user is not able to redeem the underlying asset with UXD because only the controller can call the deposit or withdraw method in underlying depository.

## Impact

Unregistering a depository that has open position can lock user's fund. During the fund locking period, bad things can happen to slash user's fund, for example, the market price falls and liquidated long position for perp protocol depository and user is able to redeem that part of the underlying asset.

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol not unregister a depository when the depository hold user's fund.
