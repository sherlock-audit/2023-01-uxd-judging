# Tokens might be stuck in the contract

## Summary
The `UXDController` contract has whitelisted tokens which can be used as collateral. The `whitelistAsset ( )` function is used to add or remove an asset on the whitelist as shown here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDController.sol#L98.
 
The contract checks if the asset passed is whitelisted in the `_mint ()` function as shown here: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDController.sol#L242. The same check happens when a user is redeeming their tokens via the `_redeem ()` function as shown here: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDController.sol#L316. 

Therefore a token which is not whitelisted cannot be allowed to mint or redeem. If a user mints  tokens by depositing assets then the asset is removed from the whitelist, a user cannot be able to redeem their collateral. 
## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the following ***SCENARIO***:
1. USDC is a whitelisted token and therefore Alice deposits 10000 USDC tokens via the `mint ()` function and has some UXD tokens
2. The protocol removes USDC from the whitelist
3. Alice cannot redeem her UXD for USDC because at this point the USDC tokens have been removed from the whitelist.
## Impact
Users might not be able to redeem their deposited assets once it is removed from the whitelist.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider allowing users to redeem their deposited assets even if it has been removed from the whitelist.
