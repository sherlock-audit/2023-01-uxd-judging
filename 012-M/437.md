# `_redeem` should not revert for de-whitelisted assets

## Summary
If an asset is whitelisted, then removed from the whitelist, users will be unable to redeem their `UXD`

## Vulnerability Detail
In `_redeem()`, there is a [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDController.sol#L316) that the asset to be received is whitelisted.

This means if users have deposited an asset, which is then removed from the whitelist, they are unable to redeem their `UXD`.

## Impact
Some users will be unable to redeem
