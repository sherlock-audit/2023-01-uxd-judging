# Bad governance settings can brick the governance

## Summary

UXDGovernor doesn’t have sanity checks for governor parameters.

## Vulnerability Detail

If UXDGovernor is constructed with some specific values, it will brick the governance from working.

For example, if governance accidentally sets `votingPeriod` or `votingDelay` to a tens of years, then the governance is bricked until that time.

## Impact

Locked governance.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
constructor(
    uint256 initialVotingDelay,
    uint256 initialVotingPeriod,
    uint256 initialProposalThreshold
) {
    _setVotingDelay(initialVotingDelay);
    _setVotingPeriod(initialVotingPeriod);
    _setProposalThreshold(initialProposalThreshold);
}

function _setVotingDelay(uint256 newVotingDelay) internal virtual {
    emit VotingDelaySet(_votingDelay, newVotingDelay);
    _votingDelay = newVotingDelay;
}

function _setVotingPeriod(uint256 newVotingPeriod) internal virtual {
    // voting period must be at least one block long
    require(newVotingPeriod > 0, "GovernorSettings: voting period too low");
    emit VotingPeriodSet(_votingPeriod, newVotingPeriod);
    _votingPeriod = newVotingPeriod;
}
```

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

Implement reasonable range bounds reverting where appropriate. In particular for the above apply:

- VotingDelay <= 6 months
- votingPeriod ≤ 6 months
- proposal threshold ≤ less than TOTAL_SUPPLY, if applicable
- quorumFraction ≤ 60

Add these checks to the setter / update functions in `GovernorSettings.sol`
