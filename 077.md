# If a user approves USDC to PerpDepository, anyone can call rebalance and rebalanceLite

## Summary
The `PerpDepository.rebalance` and `PerpDepository.rebalanceLite` functions take an `account` parameter.
This `account` parameter is used to transfer USDC from.

The issue is that when a user approves the `PerpDepository` to transfer USDC, anyone can call the functions and transfer USDC from this user.

One scenario that can occur is that a user approves an amount that is too large, such that another user can transfer the additional amount later.

Another scenario is that a user approves an amount with the intention to call `PerpDepository.rebalance`. However before the user calls `PerpDepository.rebalance`, another user calls `PerpDepository.rebalanceLite` with the first user's address as `account`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `PerpDepository.rebalance` and `PerpDepository.rebalanceLite` functions take an `account` parameter:

Both functions make use of the `account` parameter to transfer from it USDC:

## Impact
User A can cause tokens of other user B to be transferred in ways that user B does not intend.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the `account` parameter from both functions and use `msg.sender` instead such that `msg.sender` can only cause `transferFrom` to be executed from himself.
