# When redeeming, users can choose a different `assetToken` than the one they deposited, potentially making some users unable to redeem

## Summary
users can choose a different `assetToken` than the one they deposited, potentially grieving other users.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user calls `redeem()` to redeem their `UXD` against an asset, they can specify the `assetToken` they want to receive in the [function parameter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDController.sol#L265).
They can specify the asset they want, ie not necessarily the one they deposited when they minted.
Consequently,  some user( or users) will be "forced" to receive a different `assetToken` than the ones they deposited.

Though bad for user experience/expectations, this on its own does not lead to any loss (even if the `assetToken` is different, the value is equivalent).

The issue is for users who are blacklisted by USDC. Let us look at the following example:

- Alice sends USDC and mints   `N` UXD
- Bob, a user blacklisted by USDC, sends WETH and mints `N` UXD
- Alice redeems her `N` UXD for WETH
- Bob is now forced to receive USDC. When he calls `redeem()`, the call reverts [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDController.sol#L337) because of the USDC blacklist.

## Impact
Some users may be unable to redeem.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
You can consider using a mapping to track which `assetToken` has been deposited by a user.
But this would limit the user to deposit one type of collateral.
Another solution would be to use a different UXDcontroller for each collateral, and tracking the amount of `UXD` minted by a user, to ensure they do not redeem more than what they have minted on a given controller.
