# UXDController always takes first depository for asset while minting and redeeming.

## Summary
UXDController always takes first depository for asset while minting and redeeming. In case when depository can't handle payment(paused or reached max capacity) the tx will be reverted and user will not be able to mint with another depository.
## Vulnerability Detail
UXDController.mint allows user to mint new UXD token while depositing collateral assets into the depository.

```soldiity
    function mint(
        address assetToken,
        uint256 assetAmount,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
        address receiver
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
        // 1. check that token is approved
        // 2. get clearing house from router
        // 3. transfer tokens from msg.sender to clearing house
        // 4. execute perp tx
        // 6. mint
        IERC20 collateral = IERC20(assetToken);
        address account = msg.sender;
        if(collateral.allowance(account, address(this)) < assetAmount) {
            revert CtrlNotApproved(assetToken, account, assetAmount);
        }


        address depository = router.findDepositoryForDeposit(assetToken, assetAmount);
        collateral.transferFrom(
            account,
            depository,
            assetAmount
        );


        InternalMintParams memory mintParams = InternalMintParams({
            assetToken: assetToken,
            assetAmount: assetAmount,
            minAmountOut: minAmountOut,
            receiver: receiver,
            depository: depository
        });
        return _mint(mintParams);
    }
```
As you can see `router.findDepositoryForDeposit(assetToken, assetAmount)` is responsible to find depository for asset token.
It will do that by finding first depository for the asset.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDRouter.sol#L89-L91
```solidity
    function findDepositoryForDeposit(address assetToken, uint256) external view returns (address) {
        return _firstDepositoryForAsset(assetToken);
    }
```
So in case when we have 2 depository for same asset only the first one will be taken.
Later this depository will be deposited with assets that user has sent to controller.

But it's possible that depository will be paused or it will reach max capacity and will not allow to deposit anymore(as [in case of DnGmxSeniorVault](https://github.com/RageTrade/delta-neutral-gmx-vaults/blob/main/contracts/vaults/DnGmxSeniorVault.sol#L310)). In such case the tx will revert and user will not be able to mint new UXD, however second depository for the assets exists that can handle deposit.

Same thing is with redeeming. First depository is always providing. That means that if depository is paused then tx will revert.
## Impact
Minting and redeeming is not possible for users.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You can add new function to IDepository like `canDeposit` that will check if user can deposit with depository.
Same function `canRedeem` can be added to find correct redeeming depository.
And make router to find first depository that allows depositing or redeeming.
