# Mint with quote token is supported, but redeem for quote token is not supported in perp protocol depository integration

## Summary

Mint for quote token is supported, but redeem with quote token is not supported in perp protocol depository integration

## Vulnerability Detail

When mint with perp protocol depository, minting with quote token is supported, but redeem for quote token is not supported.

```solidity
function deposit(
	address asset,
	uint256 amount
) external onlyController returns (uint256) {
	if (asset == assetToken) {
		_depositAsset(amount);
		(, uint256 quoteAmount) = _openShort(amount);
		return quoteAmount;
	} else if (asset == quoteToken) {
		return _processQuoteMint(amount);
	} else {
		revert UnsupportedAsset(asset);
	}
}
```

note the second if statement:

```solidity
else if (asset == quoteToken) {
		return _processQuoteMint(amount);
```

However, when redeeming,

the redeem for quote token transaction

```solidity
    /// @notice Redeem an amount of redeemable token.
    /// @dev This handles redeeming for either `assetToken` or `quoteToken`.
    /// If `assetToken` is specified, we use the delta-neutral strategy and close part of the
    /// short position. This frees up asset collateral which can then be returned to the user.
    /// If `quoteToken` is specified, we use the quote redeem strategy where we withdraw quote token
    /// which can be returned to the caller. This is only possible if we have a positive PnL > amount being redeemed.
    /// @param asset The asset to receive from this redemption
    /// @param amount The amount of redeemable to redeem
    /// @return amountOut The amount of `asset` released from this redemption
    function redeem(
        address asset,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyController returns (uint256) {
        if (asset == assetToken) {
            (uint256 base, ) = _openLong(amount);
            _withdrawAsset(base, address(controller));
            return base;
        } else if (asset == quoteToken) {
            revert QuoteRedeemDisabled(msg.sender);
            // return _processQuoteRedeem(amount);
        } else {
            revert UnsupportedAsset(asset);
        }
    }
```

the implementation also does not align with the comment as well:

```solidity
 /// If `quoteToken` is specified, we use the quote redeem strategy where we withdraw quote token
```

## Impact

This reduce the option for user.

For example, if assetToken is USDC and the quote token is WETH, 

user can mint with USDC, but have to redeem with WETH and expose themselves to the volaitity of of the quote token.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the project address to comment

```solidity
 /// If `quoteToken` is specified, we use the quote redeem strategy where we withdraw quote token
```

and let user redeem for quote token as well.
