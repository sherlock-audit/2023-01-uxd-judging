# `UXDRouter::registerDepository` can register another `assetToken`'s depository

## Summary

There are no checks on whether the depository to register is matched to the `assetToken`. This could lead to breaking protocol functions and possible loss of funds. Assuming different depositories will support the same `assetToken` is not recommended.

## Vulnerability Detail

When `UXDRouter::registerDepository` is called the only checks are related to checking whether it is already registered. This means a depository that doesn't support an `assetToken` would still succeed in registration.

```solidity
function registerDepository(address depository, address assetToken)
        external
        onlyOwner
    {
        address found = _checkDepositoriesForAsset(assetToken, depository);
        if (found != address(0)) {
            revert Exists(assetToken, depository);
        }
        _depositoriesForAsset[assetToken].push(depository);

        emit DepositoryRegistered(assetToken, depository);
    }
```

Consider a scenario where we have whitelisted `assetToken1` and  `assetToken2` and their supported depositories being `assetToken1Depository`, `assetToken2Depository`. 
There's are checks to prevent `assetToken2Depository` being registered for `assetToken1`.

This becomes a major issue more so when a user is trying to redeem  `UXD` for `assetToken1`. The Controller will attempt to  open a long position on the wrong depository. 

If for example the wrong depository was PerDepository, this would succeed as only the amount is provided to the `_openLong()` function.

```solidity
function _openLong(uint256 amount)
        private
        returns (uint256, uint256)
    {
        (uint256 baseAmount, uint256 quoteAmount) = _placePerpOrder(
            amount,
            false, // isShort
            true, // isExactInput
            0 // sqrtPriceLimitX96
        );
        redeemableUnderManagement -= quoteAmount;

        return (baseAmount, quoteAmount);
    }
```

## Impact

This could lead to breaking protocol functions and possible loss of funds. For instance the delta neutral strategy would be affected as long positions would be opened on the wrong asset.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A possible solution would be to add a whitelist for which assetTokens a depository supports.
