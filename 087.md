# Return value of ERC20 transfer is unchecked in _withdrawAsset()

## Summary

In the _withdrawAsset() function of the PerpDepository contract, the return value of `IERC20(assetToken).transfer(to, amount);` is not checked.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the call to transfer is done and a failure occurs, no revert occurs but a result of "false" is returned. This could lead to an assumption that a transfer of the collateral amount to be used in a delta-neutral position succeeded even if it failed.

## Impact

A transfer of the required collateral could fail but the _withdrawAsset() function would not revert. This will impact the functionality of maintaining the delta-neutral position.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function _withdrawAsset(uint256 amount, address to) private {
        if (amount > netAssetDeposits) {
            revert InsufficientAssetDeposits(netAssetDeposits, amount);
        }
        netAssetDeposits -= amount;

        vault.withdraw(address(assetToken), amount);
        IERC20(assetToken).transfer(to, amount);
    }
```

## Recommendation

Wrap the call into a require() or use openzeppelin's SafeERC20 library.
