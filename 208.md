# [NAZ-M2] `findDepositoryForDeposit()` Always Finds First Depository Even If Soft Cap Is Reached

## Summary
`findDepositoryForDeposit()` doesn't check if soft cap is reached when depositing causing it to always find the first depository and try to deposit in it without check the next best.

## Vulnerability Detail
When calling `mint()` the router function `findDepositoryForDeposit()` which finds the first depository for a given market and returns it. It transfers the asset to the depository and calls the internal `_mint()` function that then calls the `deposit()` function of the depository. Inside `deposit()` it calls the internal function `_openShort()` that has a check if the `redeemableSoftCap` has been reached before continuing. The issue arises if the `redeemableSoftCap` of said depository is reached it will revert and doesn't try to find the next depository. 

## Impact
This will prevent users from depositing when the first depository has reached its soft cap even if the next one hasn't.

## Recommendation
Consider reworking the logic so that `findDepositoryForDeposit()` can check if a depository has reached it's soft cap it should then return the next depository.
