# UXDController doesn't check result when transfer ERC20 token

## Summary
UXDController doesn't check result when transfer ERC20 token. Because of that it's possible that protocl will not receive collateral from depositor, but will minx UXD, or it will burn user's UXD, but will not send back collateral.
## Vulnerability Detail
UXDController doesn't check result when transfer ERC20 token in `mint` and `_redeem` functions. In case if transfer was not successful, then protocol will not notice that, but still will continue minting or redeeming.
So in case of minting then it's possible that user will not pay but will receive UXD tokens.
And in case of redeeming it's possible that user will pay UXD tokens, but protocol will not send collateral token to him.
## Impact
Lost of funds for protocol or users.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use safe lib to handle both cases when token is returning bool and where not.
