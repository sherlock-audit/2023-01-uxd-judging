# Failed transfer with low level call could be overlooked

## Summary
Usage of low level functions can result in failed transfers, if contract existence is not checked

## Vulnerability Detail
In line https://github.com/UXDProtocol/uxd-evm/blob/sherlock-audit/contracts/core/UXDController.sol#L304, the function uses the `call` function. `call` function returns `true` , if the contract doesn't exist. Thus a transfer, that in reality has failed, but will not revert because there is no contract present on `receiver` address. 
The contract doesn't check if the `receiver` address contains any code or not, before transferring funds to it. Hence this will lead to loss of fund.

## Impact
Loss of funds.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
        (bool success,) = receiver.call{value: amountOut}("");
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check for contract existence on low-level calls, so that failures are not missed.
