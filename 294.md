# Inability to redeem UXD when Perp Protocol is Paused can cause a depeg and loss of funds for users

## Summary
 Inability to open a 'long perp` position on `Perp protocol` will prevent a user from a redeeming $UXD for $WETH -> current code base does not provide an alternative to redeem $UXD when long perp position cannot be opened. This could cause a depeg and a bank-run scenario leading to loss of user funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
When user calls a `redeem` function, protocol opens a long perp position by calling `_openLong` function in [Line 269 of PerpDespository.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L269). This function inturn calls the `openPosition` function in `clearingHouse` contract  in [Line 367](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L367). Note that this function ais using a `WhenNotPaused` modifier [in Line 367 of ClearingHouse.sol in Perp curie codebase here](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-contract/blob/27ea8e2c4be37d1dd58c1eed3b3cc269d398a091/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L382). If Perp protocol pauses opening new positions, this function reverts & hence a user cannot redeem $UXD for asset. 

I have modified the `MockPerpClearingHouse.sol` to make it a Pausable function (current mock version of ClearingHouse is not inline with Perp contract that is OwnerPausable). To run this test case, I had to change the MockPerpClearingHouse contract

```
contract MockPerpClearingHouse is Pausable {
...
    function pauseClearing() public {
        _pause();
    }

    function unpauseClearing() public {
        _unpause();
    }
...

}
``` 
Created a new deployment fixture that is same as `deployPerpDepositoryFixture` - only change is that it also returns `clearingHouse` contract

Following test case successfully reverts :

```
    it("can withdraw collateral when clearingHousePaused", async () => {
        const { depository, controller, vault, baseToken, clearingHouse } = await loadFixture(
            deployPerpDepositoryPausableFixture
        )
        const collateralAmount = ethers.utils.parseEther("1")

        const vaultBaseBalanceBefore = await baseToken.balanceOf(vault.address)
        const collateralDepositedBefore = await depository.netAssetDeposits()

        await (await baseToken.transfer(depository.address, collateralAmount)).wait()
        await (await controller.deposit(baseToken.address, collateralAmount)).wait()

        await (await clearingHouse.connect(admin).pauseClearing()).wait() // PAUSING CLEARING HOUSE
        // await (await controller.withdraw(baseToken.address, collateralAmount, bob.address)).wait()

        await expect(
            controller.withdraw(baseToken.address, collateralAmount, bob.address)
        ).to.be.revertedWith("Pausable: paused")

    })
```

## Impact
Here is a proof-of-concept for a depeg scenario (assumes  UXD-USDC pool is liquid on AMM like Curve)

1. A USDC whale front-runs `pause` transaction of Perp V2 protocol  & mints a large quantity of $UXD (say $10m)
2. Whale then dumps 20% of UXD into a Curve pool for USDC and creates an initial depeg
3. Arb bots notice depeg & try to redeem UXD for USDC on UXD protocol but fail because no new positions can be opened on Perp protocol (contract in paused state)
5. Depeg gets wider with time without a auto-correction mechanism that can quickly turn into `run-on-the-bank` scenario
6. Whale simply waits till sufficient depeg, buys back a large amount of UXD at a de-pegged rate
7. Whale waits till Perp protocol unpauses -> goes to UXD Protocol to redeem and get back a 1:1 conversion


Profit that the whale makes in this scenario comes at the expense of depeg losses borne by regular users. Regular users might not know the internal working of `delta neutral strategies` and not be aware of critical dependence on `Perp protocol`. They might interpret a denial-of-service (even if temporary) as a proof that the stablecoin has depegged. And as we've seen with stablecoin depegs, a small depeg can quickly turn into a large one due to mass panic.

Any hedge fund running MEV bots with sufficient capital can launch an attack based on this vulnerability & lack of awareness among regular UXD holders. Recent attack on [Aave](https://cointelegraph.com/news/mango-markets-hacker-allegedly-feigns-curve-short-attack-to-exploit-aave) has demonstrated that such short squeeze attacks are possible

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Protocol should have an alternate way to enable emergency redemptions when `Perp protocol` pauses their protocol. Current design of protocol has a critical dependence on Perp protocol because of the need to maintain a dynamic delta neutral strategy. Just like the concept of `insurance` implemented by protocol, an `emergency asset vault` must be called to enable redemptions when `Perp protocol` cannot open new position
