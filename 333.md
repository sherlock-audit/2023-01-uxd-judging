# Permissionless receive ETH

## Summary
The Permissionless receive function might lead to native assets being stuck in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
```UXDController``` has an empty unprotected receive function:
```solidity
    /// @notice Fallback function for this contract to receive ETH
    // solhint-disable-next-line no-empty-blocks
    receive() external payable {}
```
This means anyone can send ETH to this contract. However, based on my assumptions it is intended to receive ETH only from the WETH contract when withdrawing the tokens.

## Impact

If ETH accidentally reaches this contract, there will be no way to recover it unless the contract is upgraded.
