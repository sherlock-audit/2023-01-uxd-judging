# [NAZ-M7] `DnGmxSeniorVault.sol` Has a `maxUtilizationBps` Cap on Withdraws But `RageDnDepository.sol` Has No Soft Cap For This

## Summary
Deposits have a soft cap but withdraws don't which could lead to unexpected reverts for users.

## Vulnerability Detail
`DnGmxSeniorVault.sol` is the vault used by `RageDnDepository.sol` for deposits and withdraws. In the `DnGmxSeniorVault.sol` code there is both a [`depositCap`](https://github.com/RageTrade/delta-neutral-gmx-vaults/blob/main/contracts/vaults/DnGmxSeniorVault.sol#L130) && [`maxUtilizationBps`](https://github.com/RageTrade/delta-neutral-gmx-vaults/blob/main/contracts/vaults/DnGmxSeniorVault.sol#L152) both are used to cap deposits and withdraws respectively. `RageDnDepository.sol` has a soft cap for deposits I'm assuming for this reason, however it doesn't have a soft cap for withdraws that can lead to unexpected reverts in extreme cases.

## Impact
As stated in `DnGmxSeniorVault.sol` natspec:
> maximum utilization that vault is allowed to go upto on withdrawals (beyond this withdrawals would fail)

Without a similar soft cap users withdrawal will unexpectedly revert if the `maxUtilizationBps` cap were ever to be reached.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a similar soft cap to withdraws like the one for deposits.
