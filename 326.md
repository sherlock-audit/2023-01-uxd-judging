# Missing approval of `quoteToken` to `vault` in `PerpDepository._rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap()`

## Summary
In `PerpDepository._rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap()`, `vault` is not approved `quoteToken` so `vault.deposit()` will always revert. Rebalancing will not work, putting the peg of UXD at risk.

## Vulnerability Detail
`vault.deposit()` pulls funds from the caller, but `quoteToken` is not approved before the call, so `rebalance()` will revert.

## Impact
If rebalancing doesn't work, then there is a high risk that UXD will loose its peg.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Approve `quoteAmount` of `quoteToken` to `vault` before depositing to the `vault`.
