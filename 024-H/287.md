# Function `rebalance()` can be called with arbitrary `account` input param lead to unexpected loss for `account` in case the trade cause a loss

## Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L446

## Vulnerability Detail
Function `rebalance()` does a swap on a DEX (Uniswap in this case) to convert `assetToken` to `quoteToken` then deposit back to vault. 

Swap can cause a loss in fees and slippage and when it happens, funds will be pulled from `account` address to make up for the loss. However, `account` address is arbitrary address specified by sender. It means that sender can choose which account to pay the loss. 

Consider the scenario:
1. User A approved to PerpDepository to use their funds.
2. User A call `rebalance()`.
3. User B (attacker) front-run TX in step 2 and use User A funds in another swap through and cause a loss for User A.

## Impact
Unexpected loss for address has approved to PerpDepository contract.

## Code Snippet
Anyone can call `rebalance()` with arbitrary params
```solidity
function rebalance(
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 amountOutMinimum,
    uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96,
    uint24 swapPoolFee,
    int8 polarity,
    address account // @audit any account ???
) external nonReentrant returns (uint256, uint256) {
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a mechanism to make sure sender is allowed to pull funds from `account` to do the trade.
