# `PerpDepository::rebalanceLite` does not check if caller is authorized to use another user's account for rebalancing

## Summary

Anyone can call `PerpDepository::rebalanceLite` lets users specify another user's account as the one that will have their quoteToken used.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user calls `PerpDepository::rebalanceLite` and specifies another user's address as the `account`, the only requirement is that the `account` must have pre-approved the contract to spend `quoteToken`. Therefore anyone who has approved the contract to spend their `quoteToken` can have their address used when the function is being called.

```solidity
    /// @param amount The amount of PnL to rebalance in quote token decimals.
    /// @param polarity The direction of the rebalance. -1 for negative PnL, +1 for positive PnL.
    /// @param sqrtPriceLimitX96 The target price when placing the perp order to resize the delta neutral position.
    /// @param account The account doing the rebalancing. This account must provide the collateral
    /// or quote amount and receives the other side after the swap.
    /// @return (baseAmount, quoteAmount) the amount rebalanced in baseAmount and quoteAmount.
    function rebalanceLite(
        uint256 amount,
        int8 polarity,
        uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96,
        address account
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256, uint256) 
```

The account specified will then have the amount transfered from their address even though they may not want their account to be used.

```solidity
        IERC20(quoteToken).transferFrom(account, address(this), amount);
        IERC20(quoteToken).approve(address(vault), amount);
        vault.deposit(quoteToken, amount);
```

A user could have previously approved the contract when interacting with the protocol.

## Impact

This would leave to anyone who has approved the contract previously to be suspectible to third parties using their quoteTokens for rebalancing.
