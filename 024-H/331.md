# Rebalance with any account

## Summary
Rebalance functions can be called with an arbitrary ```account``` address.

## Vulnerability Detail
Functions ```rebalance``` and ```rebalanceLite``` accept an ```account``` parameter with an intention to cover the difference:
_"If there is any shortfall in the swap `account` covers the difference."_
```solidity
function rebalance(
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 amountOutMinimum,
        uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96,
        uint24 swapPoolFee,
        int8 polarity,
        address account
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256, uint256) {
```
```solidity
function rebalanceLite(
        uint256 amount,
        int8 polarity,
        uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96,
        address account
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256, uint256) {
```

The funds from the account are transferred depending on the protocol state:
```solidity
        if (shortFall > 0) {
            IERC20(quoteToken).transferFrom(
                account,
                address(this),
                uint256(shortFall)
            );
        } else if (shortFall < 0) {
            // we got excess tokens in the spot swap. Send them to the account paying for rebalance
            IERC20(quoteToken).transfer(
                account,
                _abs(shortFall)
            );
        }
```
```solidity
        ...
        IERC20(quoteToken).transferFrom(account, address(this), amount);
        ...
        IERC20(assetToken).transfer(account, baseAmount);
        ...
```

The problem is that anyone can call rebalance functions, and specify any account. If this account has approved this address but did not intend to rebalance, this approval can still be front-runned by anyone to rebalance the protocol.

For example, ```depositInsurance``` transfers ```quoteToken``` from the owner-specified address, but this address has to be given prior approval. However, once the approval is given, anyone can use these funds to rebalance.

## Impact
```account``` funds can be moved by anyone supposedly sufficient approval is given to the ```PerpDepository```.
Many users forget to reset approvals or approve for max amount, and thus might lead to surprises.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
One possible mitigation is to check the allowance from ```account``` to ```msg.sender``` if ```msg.sender != account```.
