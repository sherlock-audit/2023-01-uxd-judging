# Use .call instead of .transfer

## Summary
Use .call instead of .transfer, In general, it is generally a good idea to use the call function when interacting with external contracts, particularly if you are calling functions that perform critical operations (e.g. transferring assets). This is because the call function allows you to call functions on external contracts while providing some additional security checks and protection against reentrancy attacks.

        if (!(IERC20(token).transfer(to, amount))) {

## Impact
In contrast, the `transfer` function is a convenience function that is provided by the ERC20 standard for transferring tokens. It is implemented as a combination of a call to the `transfer` function followed by a `send` (which is similar to a call but with no return value). The `transfer` function is intended to be a simple and easy-to-use way to transfer tokens, but it does not provide the same level of security as the call function.

In the specific case of the `transferERC20` function, it appears that the transfer function is being called on an `ERC20` contract specified by the token parameter. If the `transfer` function were to fail (e.g. due to an error or exception), the contract will revert with the specified error message.

## Code Snippet
        `if (!(IERC20(token).transfer(to, amount))) {`

## Recommendation
```solidity

        address token,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyGovernance nonReentrant {
        if (!(IERC20(token).call(to, amount))) {
            revert GovERC20TransferFailed(token, to, amount);
        }
    }
}
