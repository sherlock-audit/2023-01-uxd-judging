# [M-03] Potential Lock Of Ethers

## Summary

The `UXDController` contract implements the `receive()` function to receive `Ethers` (native coin) from the `WETH` contract during the `WETH` unwrapping process. 

However, the `receive()` function also receives `Ethers` from EOA (Externally Owned Account) wallets or other smart contracts, resulting in the lock of `Ethers` by mistake. Even if this is not considered the UXD protocol's error directly, the mistake could be preventable by the protocol in the first place (applying the `security-by-design principles`).

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `UXDController` contract, the `receive()` function is implemented (L89 in Snippet 1) for accepting `Ethers` (native coin). 

The `receive()` function would obtain `Ethers` from the `WETH` contract if users want to redeem their `UXD` tokens for `Ethers` (during the `WETH` unwrapping process). In other words, users invoke the `UXDController.redeemForEth()` function to redeem their `UXD` tokens for `Ethers`.

SNIPPET: 1
FILE: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDController.sol
LOCATIONS: L89

87:     /// @notice Fallback function for this contract to receive ETH
88:     // solhint-disable-next-line no-empty-blocks
89: *   receive() external payable {}
```

Nevertheless, I found that the current implementation of the `receive()` function does not only receive `Ethers` from the `WETH` contract but also other smart contracts or even EOA (Externally Owned Account) wallets.

**Since the `UXDController` is a forefront contract directly interacting with users or other contracts, the possibility that the users or other contracts would send `Ethers` to this contract by mistake is MEDIUM, resulting in the lock of `Ethers` eternally.**

### Proof Of Concept

The snippet below shows my Proof-of-Concept code to prove that the `UXDController` contract can receive `Ethers` from an end-user.

Please insert this code in `test/core/UXDController.test.ts` (existing file).

```typescript
it("PoC M-03 -- can send Ethers to the UXDController by mistake", async () => {
    const {controller} = await loadFixture(controllerFixture);
    const amount = ethers.utils.parseEther("10");

    const uxdControllerEtherBalanceBefore = await ethers.provider.getBalance(controller.address);
    const bobEtherBalanceBefore = await ethers.provider.getBalance(bob.address);

    // Send 10 Ethers to UXDController by mistake
    await bob.sendTransaction({to: controller.address, value: amount});

    const uxdControllerEtherBalanceAfter = await ethers.provider.getBalance(controller.address);
    const bobEtherBalanceAfter = await ethers.provider.getBalance(bob.address);

    // Expect 10 Ethers must be sent to the UXDController
    expect(uxdControllerEtherBalanceAfter).to.equal(uxdControllerEtherBalanceBefore.add(amount));

    // Expect Bob's Ether balance must be deducted by 10 + some gas for paying the tx
    expect(bobEtherBalanceAfter).to.lt(bobEtherBalanceBefore.sub(amount));
});
```

## Impact

**Since the `UXDController` is a forefront contract directly interacting with users or other contracts, the possibility that the users or other contracts would send `Ethers` to this contract by mistake is MEDIUM (the likelihood), resulting in the lock of `Ethers` eternally (the impact is MEDIUM).**

**Even if this is not considered the UXD protocol's error directly, the mistake could be preventable by the protocol in the first place (applying the `security-by-design principles`). For this reason, the risk of this issue is MEDIUM.**

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To remediate this issue, I recommend improving the `receive()` function like L90 in the below snippet. The improved function enforces receiving only `Ethers` from the `WETH` contract.

88:     // solhint-disable-next-line no-empty-blocks
89:     receive() external payable { 
90: *       require(msg.sender == weth, "Only receive ETH from the WETH contract"); 
91:     }
```
