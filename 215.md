# [NAZ-M9] `DnGmxSeniorVault.sol` Has Upgradability Features That Can Brick `RageDnDepository.sol` Until Its Also Upgraded

## Summary
If `DnGmxSeniorVault.sol` where to ever be upgraded `RageDnDepository.sol` would revert until upgraded itself which could take some time and cost users to loss out on profitable opportunities. 

## Vulnerability Detail
`DnGmxSeniorVault.sol` is the vault used by `RageDnDepository.sol` for deposits and withdraws. This particular vault is an `ERC4626Upgradeable` and upon upgrading can brick `RageDnDepository.sol` until it too is upgraded. This is because there is no current way to set the address of `DnGmxSeniorVault.sol` after initialization.

## Impact
If there is an extreme case that requires the Rage Trade team to upgrade their vault to save funds that would be at risk. This would prompt a swift and stealthy action to do so, leaving `RageDnDepository.sol` to revert for several functions leaving it at risk if critical actions are needed to be done.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding the ability to set new vault so that `RageDnDepository.sol` doesn't need to be upgraded in such an extreme case.
