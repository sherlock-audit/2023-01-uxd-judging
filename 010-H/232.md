# Assets can be stolen when rebalancing if there are excess tokens in spot swap

## Summary
In the case when `shortFall < 0`, assets can be stolen by anyone as `rebalance()` has no access control, and `account` is an arbitrary input.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `_rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap()`, depending on the polarity of `shortFall`, assets are either taken awayy from `account` or transferred to `account. 

> // we got excess tokens in the spot swap. Send them to the account paying for rebalance

We see in the commented assumption that if there are excess tokens, they are sent to the account that paid for rebalance.

However, this is not true as an account that has been paying for rebalances is not neccessarily the one that is receiving the excess token. `account` is an arbitrary address and can be used by a malicious user to call this function only when `shortFall < 0`. In fact, a malicious user can repeatedly call the function with no penalty by simply having its approval to be 0, and it will always revert if `account` is required to pay, but on successful calls, receive assets.

```solidity
    function _rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap(
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 amountOutMinimum,
        uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96,
        uint24 swapPoolFee,
        address account
    ) private returns (uint256, uint256) {
        ...
        int256 shortFall = int256(
            quoteAmount.fromDecimalToDecimal(18, ERC20(quoteToken).decimals())
        ) - int256(quoteAmountOut);
        if (shortFall > 0) {
            IERC20(quoteToken).transferFrom(
                account,
                address(this),
                uint256(shortFall)
            );
        } else if (shortFall < 0) {
            // we got excess tokens in the spot swap. Send them to the account paying for rebalance
            IERC20(quoteToken).transfer(
                account,
                _abs(shortFall)
            );
        }
        ...
    }
```



## Impact

It can be the case that the `account` that always pays for rebalance, never actually gets back excess tokens when there is an excess.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is unclear who `account` should be. We probably should not be allowing `account` to be an arbitrary input since `rebalance()` has no access control.
