# Anyone can call `rebalance()` to get excess tokens when `shortFall < 0`, these excess tokens are not used in `rebalance()`

## Summary

Anyone can call `rebalance()` to get excess tokens when `shortFall < 0`, these excess tokens are not used in `rebalance()`.

## Vulnerability Detail

`rebalance()` will check that if `shortFall < 0`, it will send excess tokens to the `account` paying for rebalance.

```solidity
        if (shortFall > 0) {
            IERC20(quoteToken).transferFrom(
                account,
                address(this),
                uint256(shortFall)
            );
        } else if (shortFall < 0) {
            // we got excess tokens in the spot swap. Send them to the account paying for rebalance
            IERC20(quoteToken).transfer(
                account,
                _abs(shortFall)
            );
        }
```

If `shortFall > 0`, the `account` should pay for rebalance, else the `account` will receive excess tokens.

In smart contract, itâ€™s easy to call `rebalance()` and control that only revert when `shortFall > 0`. Anyone can surely avoid `shortFall > 0` to pay for rebalance, and always get excess tokens by setting any `account` parameter when `shortFall < 0`.

## Impact

Anyone can get excess tokens, and these excess tokens are not used in `rebalance()`. No one will call `rebalance()` when `shortFall > 0`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use a treasury account and hard-code the account address in the contract rather than using an account parameter.
Or use the modifier onlyOwner on `rebalance()`.
