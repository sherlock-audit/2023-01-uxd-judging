# Missing check on `account` in `PerpDepository.rebalanceLite()`

## Summary
in `PerpDepository.rebalanceLite()` the input parameter `account` can be set by the caller without restriction. 
- Any user account with residual approval to this contract can be forced to rebalance-lite and have `quoteToken` swapped for `assetToken` 

## Vulnerability Detail
When user A calls `rebalanceLite()`, he must approve first the `PerpDepository` with `quoteToken` and if some residual approval is left, an attacker can swap this approval of user A with `assetToken` without user A consent, by calling `rebalanceLite()` with `account` = user A address.

## Impact
Users with residual approval can be forced to rebalance-lite, and obtain `assetToken` in exchange. This can lead to losses for users if the `assetToken` looses value.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Rebalance lite should check that `account == msg.sender`
