# Missing check on `account` in `PerpDepository.rebalance()`

## Summary
in `PerpDepository.rebalance()` the input parameter `account` can be set by the caller without restriction. 
- Any user account with residual approval to this contract can be forced to pay the shortfall. 
- An attacker can simulate transactions to see when the shortfall should be negative and put its address to gain the shortfall

## Vulnerability Detail
`account` is fed to `_rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap()` where it is used to:
- pull `quoteToken` from to pay the shortfall from it if `shortFall` is positive
- transfer `quoteToken` to send the excess if `shortFall` is negative

When Alice calls `rebalanceLite()`, she must approve first the `PerpDepository` with `quoteToken`. If after `rebalanceLite()` is called there is some residual approval, then `rebalance()` can be called by Anyone passing Alice's address as `account` to make Alice pay for the shortfall. 

Also, an attacker could simulate calls to `rebalance()` to know when the `Shorfall` is negative and call `rebalance()` whith its address as `account` to get the excess tokens after rebalancing.

## Impact
Users with residual approval can be forced to pay for the cost of rebalancing, also the benefits of potentially having a negative shortfall (excess tokens after rebalancing) can be nullified by a malicious attacker who can steal the excess tokens.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Rebalance should be some fixed protocol owned address that allows for paying the shortfall.
