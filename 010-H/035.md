# Risk free profit by exploiting negative PNL rebalancing

## Summary

Anyone can call https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L597 and provide both the amount and the receiver account. The hacker can perform the following actions to make a profit out of a negative PNL position in PerpDepository.

-> Open flash loan of a good amount of eth
-> Inflate `quote` by swapping eth against quote token using UniswapV3 interface.
-> call `rebalanceLite` with X quote token, the hacker account and 0 as sqrtPriceLimitX96 to disable protection against price manipulation. This swaps X quote token against Y base token which has been virtually deflated by the previous operation leading to a bigger amount of base than without the swap.
-> Swap quote against eth using UniswapV3 which restores the price of base.
-> Close flash loan with returned eth
-> Profit

The maximum tradable amount of quote token through `rebalanceLite()` is `min(-PnL, vault.balanceOf(assetToken))` with PnL<0 guaranteed by https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L684
