# Depository can pull USDC from arbitrary addresses upon rebalance

## Summary

`_rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap` and `_rebalanceNegativePnlLite` in `PerpDepository` might pull USDC from arbitrary account as the `account` parameter is not validated.

## Vulnerability Detail

`rebalance()` and `rebalanceLite()` are both external function which can perform PnL rebalancing in case the PnL is negative. Both function take an `account` parameter. 

An attacker might perform a rebalance by entering an arbitrary address which has approved the Depository to use his USDC funds (e.g. because the rightful owner of the address has called the rebalance functions earlier and approved the contract to spend all their available USDC).

In case of `rebalance()` (calling `_rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap()`), USDC will be pulled from `account` if there is a shortfall in USDC in case the swap from ETH to USDC didnâ€™t provide enough USDC to cover the negative PnL:

```solidity
function _rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap(
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 amountOutMinimum,
    uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96,
    uint24 swapPoolFee,
    address account
) private returns (uint256, uint256) {
	...
	if (shortFall > 0) {
	    IERC20(quoteToken).transferFrom(
	        account,
	        address(this),
	        uint256(shortFall)
	    );
	}
	...
}
```

In case of `rebalanceLite()` (calling `_rebalanceNegativePnlLite()`), the account has to provide all the USDC to cover the negative PnL: 

```solidity
function _rebalanceNegativePnlLite(
    uint256 amount,
    uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96,
    address account
) private returns (uint256, uint256) {
	...
	IERC20(quoteToken).transferFrom(account, address(this), amount);
	...
}
```

## Impact

An attacker might scan which addresses approved the Depository to spend their USDC funds and use these addresses to perform a rebalance in case of a negative PnL. This will lead to a loss of funds for the specified addresses.

## Recommendation

Pull the funds from msg.sender instead of from the account specified in the function arguments.
