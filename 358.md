# User/Gov's quoteToken allowance which is approved for `depositInsurance()` will be maliciously used on `rebalance()`

## Summary

User/Gov's quoteToken allowance which is approved for `depositInsurance()` will be maliciously used on `rebalance()`.

## Vulnerability Detail

It's a requirement to approve `insuranceToken` (the same as `quoteToken`) first before calling `depositInsurance()`.

```solidity
    function depositInsurance(uint256 amount, address from)
        external
        nonReentrant
        onlyOwner
    {
        if (amount == 0) {
            revert ZeroAmount();
        }
        uint256 allowance = IERC20(insuranceToken()).allowance(
            from,
            address(this)
        );
        if (allowance < amount) {
            revert NotApproved(allowance, amount);
        }
```

But if the allowance is set, anyone can use this allowance to call `rebalance()` before the owner calls `depositInsurance()`. Because `rebalance()` also requires someone to approve `quoteToken` first.

If Alice has approved quoteToken for `depositInsurance()` but hasn't called `depositInsurance()` yet, an attacker Bob can call `rebalance()` and set the `account` parameter to Aliceâ€™s account. Alice will spend the allowance and pay for rebalance if `shortFall > 0`, but this allowance is for `depositInsurance()`.

## Impact

It's a common griefing scenario for smart contract attacks that the owner will be unable to call `depositInsurance()` due to lack of allowance.

Furthermore, it's more serious if the owner is DAO and it needs to wait for DAO members to vote on any executions. The attacker will have more time to call `rebalance()` before the owner calls `depositInsurance()`, without the need to frontrun the owner's `depositInsurance()` transaction.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use a specific account for `rebalance()` rather than using an account parameter.
Or use the modifier onlyOwner on `rebalance()`.
