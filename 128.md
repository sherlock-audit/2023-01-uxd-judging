# Lack of open position check in PerpDepository.sol

## Summary
If a PerpDepository position in the external exchange gets liquidated, 
there is no emergency way to setup the right amount again for the depository to be delta neutral, which can lead to significant losses for the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
In PerpDepository.sol, the controller uses the following function to deposit:

```solidity
function deposit(
    address asset,
    uint256 amount
) external onlyController returns (uint256) {
    if (asset == assetToken) {
        _depositAsset(amount);
        (, uint256 quoteAmount) = _openShort(amount);
        return quoteAmount;
    } else if (asset == quoteToken) {
        return _processQuoteMint(amount);
    } else {
        revert UnsupportedAsset(asset);
    }
}
```

in the case `asset == assetToken` the protocol opens a short position on the exchange, which can be liquidated if the base asset gains value against quote significantly.

## Impact

The protocol loses its delta neutrality and incurs significant loss.

## Recommendation

Add a check to verify that current positions on external exchange match the internal accounting of PerpDepository, and are enough to keep it delta neutral.
