# redeemableUnderManagement is not updated after position rebalancing in PerpDepository

## Summary

The state variable `redeemableUnderManagement` is mirroring the amount of quote in the depository and maintained up-to-date to be able to compute the unrealized P&L of the position thanks to [getUnrealizedPnl](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L429)

This state variable is mirroring the amount of quote in the depository. It is increased when a short position on asset token is opened and decreased when a long position is opened. It is also increased when an amount of quote token is directly deposited as shown with the following links.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L319
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L340
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L392

However, the variable is not updated when the position is being rebalanced after a call to either [rebalance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L446) or [rebalanceLite](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L597). Therefore, this equivalent to the loss not being accounted as realized and the amount of unrealized PL remains after the rebalance.

Consequently, and since anybody can call rebalance, a malicious user could call it as many times as needed with a maximum amount equivalent to the negative PL and up to the point when the position is fully unbalanced with only base and no quote anymore.

This would totally break the delta neutral strategy and this is accessible to any user given the position has a negative P&L.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

Any malicious user can break the delta-neutral strategy.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Properly update the variable `redeemableUnderManagement`. Also, why not control who can call rebalance as a safety measure?
