# WETH (`assetToken`) & USDC (`quoteToken`) can be stuck forever in `PerpDepository.sol`

## Summary
There is no way to rescue `assetToken` (WETH) and `quoteToken` (USDC) form the `PerpDepository.sol` contract.
Due to accounting problems & reliance on external sources (Like uniswap V3 Swaps, and Perpetual protocol deposits and withdraws, yield, etc), WETH tokens can be stuck forever in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `PerpDepository.sol` uses perpetuals protocol to manage delta neutral strategies,
and it manages 2 main tokens:
1) `quoteToken` - USDC
2) `assetToken` - WETH

Due to accounting issues and swaps slippage some WETH & USDC might get stuck in the contract and it would be never be retrievable, by the admins or by anyone.

The two tokens are being held by the contract in many occasions:
1) When users mint UXD tokens using the `UXDController.sol`, their collateral is being sent to the depository and then deposited into perpetual protocol.
2) When admin calls the `depositInsurance` function usdc is being sent to the depository
3) When a user calls the `rebalance` function which triggers the `_rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap` which swaps WETH for USDC on uniswapV3
During all these process tokens might be stayed in the contract and locked.
Since there is no way to retrieve tokens from the contract they could be lost forever.

## Impact
User's & Protocol - USDC & WETH might get lost forever

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Create another onlyOwner function which will allow withdrawing and rescuing locked WETH and USDC from the depository.
