# Risk free profit by exploiting negative PNL rebalancing

## Summary

Anyone can call https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L597 and provide both the amount and the receiver account. Therefore, a sandwich attack is possible. The hacker can perform the following actions to make a profit out of a negative PNL position in PerpDepository.

-> Open flash loan of eth
-> Inflate `quote` by swapping eth against quote.
-> call `rebalanceLite` with X quote and the hacker account. This swaps X quote against Y base which has been virtually deflated leading to a bigger amount of base than without the swap.
-> Swap quote against eth
-> Close flash loan with returned eth
-> Profit

The maximum tradable amount is X which is worth `min(-PnL, vault.balanceOf(assetToken))` with PnL<0 guaranteed by https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L684
