# Use of transfer() may lead to failures

## Summary
Use of transfer() may lead to failures

## Vulnerability Detail
At https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDController.sol#L225

```solidity
bool transferred = IERC20(weth).transfer(depository, amount);
```
## Impact
Use call instead of transfer to send ether. And return value must be checked if sending ether is successful or not.
Sending ether with the transfer is no longer recommended.
Example:
Whenever the user either fails to implement the payable fallback function or cumulative gas cost of the function sequence invoked on a native token transfer exceeds 2300 gas consumption limit the native tokens sent end up undelivered and the corresponding user funds return functionality will fail each time.

## Code Snippet
`bool transferred = IERC20(weth).call(depository, amount);`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `call()` instead, without hardcoded gas limits along with checks-effects-interactions pattern or reentrancy guards for reentrancy protection.
`bool transferred = IERC20(weth).call(depository, amount);`
