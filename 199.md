# Timestamp dependency

## Summary

Timestamp dependency, `block.timestamp` is vulnerable to manipulation

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability of `block.timestamp` in smart contracts is related to the fact that the timestamp of a block is provided by the miner who mined the block. As a result, the timestamp is not guaranteed to be accurate or to be the same across different nodes in the network. In particular, an attacker can potentially mine a block with a timestamp that is favorable to them, known as "selective packing".

For example, an attacker could mine a block with a timestamp that is slightly in the future, allowing them to bypass a time-based restriction in a smart contract that relies on `block.timestamp`. This could potentially allow the attacker to execute a malicious action that would otherwise be blocked by the restriction.

## Code Snippet

- [contracts/integrations/uniswap/Uniswapper.sol#L39](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/uniswap/Uniswapper.sol#L39) => `deadline: block.timestamp,`
- [contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L362](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L362) => `deadline: block.timestamp,`

## Tool used

- Private self-made tool for static analysis
- Manual Review, Remix IDE

## Recommendation

Developers should avoid using `block.timestamp` in their smart contracts and instead use an alternative timestamp source, such as an oracle, that is not susceptible to manipulation by a miner.
