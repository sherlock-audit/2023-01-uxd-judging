# Possible Denial of Service When Attempting to Call `mintWithEth()`

## Summary
The `UXDController` will interact with the `PerpDepository` contracts which represents the Perpetual Protocol and allows the depository to open various positions. Currently as of block `59559174` (Approx. 4th Jan 2023) on optimism, there is a Prepetual vault deposit cap which the attacker can abuse to deny other users from interacting with the protocol. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The attacker can abuse the vault deposit cap by taking out a flashloan, deposit just enough funds into the protocol to reach the deposit cap limit, mint UXD, payback the flashloan thereby causing a denial of service condition for the rest of the users. 

## Impact
It doesnt make sense to use this attack against the prepetual vault itself because there is nothing minted in return to repay the flashloan with since the attacker is solely depositing into the vault when interacting with the perpetual protocol directly. 

On the other hand, consider the following example. Alice (the attacker) wishes to deny minting UXD for other users. She takes out a flashloan of 173.9 tokens. Alice can then deposit these tokens into the vault, and repay the flashloan from the newly minted UXD tokens. Users (in this case bob) who wish to interact with the protocol will not be able to mint new tokens because the vault will throw a `V_GTDC` error (Greater than deposit cap).

The following unit test outlines this scanario:
```javascript
    it("testDosCondition", async () => {
        // Custom forked Optimism Mainnet configuration (Block: 59559174)
        let {controller, router, depository, weth, asset, redeemable, vault} = await loadFixture(controllerFixtureWithUXAndPerp);

        // Bobs signers
        const bobController = await controller.connect(bob);

        // Alice's signers
        const aliceController = await controller.connect(alice);

        await aliceController.mintWithEth(0, alice.address, {value: ethers.utils.parseEther("173.9")});
        await expect(bobController.mintWithEth(0, bob.address, {value: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.5")})).to.be.revertedWith("V_GTDC");
        
    });
```

This was rated a High in severity because one transaction could brick the mint functionality for other users who wish to take part in the protocol and reduce the exposure that the UXD could potentially have across the ecosystem by limiting a large amount of the token supply to one wallet address.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L240-L253

## Tool used
- Manual Testing
- optimistic.etherscan.io

## Recommendation
It's recommended that the `PerpDepository.sol` contract implements a reasonable maximum deposit limit for users interacting with the protocol which can be changed using a setter.
