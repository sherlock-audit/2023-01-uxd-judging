# Vault.withdraw can lead to unexpected liquidation when the underlying asset price falls for perp protocol integration, which depegs the UXD token and make insuranceDeposited and redeemableUnderManagement out of sync

## Summary

Open or close position when mint or redeem can lead to unexpected liquidation when the underlying asset price falls

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current integration with perp protocol,

When deposit happens, the asset is deposit into vault as collateral and open a short position.

```solidity
/// @notice Deposit asset and return the amount of redeemable that can be minted.
/// @dev This is set up to handle either `assetToken` or `quoteToken` deposits.
/// If `assetToken` is deposted, we use the delta-neutral strategy and open additional
/// short position. The amount returned is the `quote` amount from opening the short.
/// If `quoteToken` is deposited, we use the "quote mint" strategy whereby we deposit
/// quote token and return an equivalant amount redeemable.
/// Quote minting is only possible if we have a negative PnL > `amount`. The amount deposited
/// is used to pay off part of this negative PnL.
/// @param asset The token to deposit
/// @param amount The amount to deposit
/// @return amountOut The amount of redeemable that can be added to the total supply.
function deposit(
	address asset,
	uint256 amount
) external onlyController returns (uint256) {
	if (asset == assetToken) {
		_depositAsset(amount);
		(, uint256 quoteAmount) = _openShort(amount);
		return quoteAmount;
	} else if (asset == quoteToken) {
		return _processQuoteMint(amount);
	} else {
		revert UnsupportedAsset(asset);
	}
}
```

note the code:

```solidity
if (asset == assetToken) {
	_depositAsset(amount);
	(, uint256 quoteAmount) = _openShort(amount);
	return quoteAmount;
}
```

When redeem happens, the collateral is removed and a long position is opened.

```solidity
function redeem(
	address asset,
	uint256 amount
) external onlyController returns (uint256) {
	if (asset == assetToken) {
		(uint256 base, ) = _openLong(amount);
		_withdrawAsset(base, address(controller));
		return base;
	} else if (asset == quoteToken) {
		revert QuoteRedeemDisabled(msg.sender);
		// return _processQuoteRedeem(amount);
	} else {
		revert UnsupportedAsset(asset);
	}
}
```

There is another case when collateral is reduced. when withdrawInsurance is called, a part of collateral is removed.

```solidity
/// @notice Withdraws insurance from this depository
/// @dev Can only be called by Owner (governance).
/// @param amount The amount to withdraw.
/// @param to The account to withdraw to.
function withdrawInsurance(uint256 amount, address to)
	external
	nonReentrant
	onlyOwner
{
	if (amount == 0) {
		revert ZeroAmount();
	}

	insuranceDeposited -= amount;

	vault.withdraw(insuranceToken(), amount);
	IERC20(insuranceToken()).transfer(to, amount);

	emit InsuranceWithdrawn(msg.sender, to, amount);
}
```

However, without managing the position with great caution, removing the collateral when vault.withdraw happens or open a short position over time can lead to liquidation when the underlying asset price changes dramatically.

When open the long position, if the underlying asset price falls, the position can be liquidated.

When open the short position, if the underlying asset price sky-rocket, the position can be liquidated.

When liquidation happens, the state: insuranceDeposited is out of sync because a part of insuranceDeposited is liquidated.

When liquidation happens, the state redeemableUnderManagement is also out of sync because a part of  redeemableUnderManagement is no longer redeemable because it is liquidated.

According to the liquidation section,

https://support.perp.com/hc/en-us/articles/5331299807513-Liquidation

> Liquidation is triggered when your position margin ratio is below 6.25%. Margin ratio is calculated using 15-minute TWAP of the index price.

> Each position has an associated liquidation price. Note that this price depends on how much collateral you deposited, and the PnL of each position. Depositing, withdrawing, and funding payments all affect your collateral, and therefore affect liquidation price.

> Liquidation Penalty

> Some or all of your margin will be taken as a liquidation penalty. Perpetual Protocol uses cross-collateral, so if you have multiple positions, liquidators can only attempt to liquidate one at a time, and will likely choose the biggest position so they can liquidate the maximum allowable amount.

## Impact

When calling vault.withdraw in perp protocol depository, the collateral is removed, and when asset token market price falls the amount of collateral falls below the position margin ratio (collateral ratio), liquidation happens.

If liquidation happens, the protocol loses a part of the collateral and that part of the asset is no longer redeemable and the UXD token becomes depegged.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol manage the position carefully, when vault.withdraw is called when fund is insurance fund is removed or more short position is opened or the collateral is removed when redeem happens, before removing the collateral, make sure the trader has enough collateral to not get liquidated.
