# UXDController.setRedeemable creates risk that users can lose deposited funds

## Summary
UXDController.setRedeemable creates risk that users can lose deposited funds when owner will change redeemable
## Vulnerability Detail
UXDController.setRedeemable allows owner to change redeemable token.
Redeemable is UXD token and UXDController is created to control operations with UXD tokens. So such setter should not even exist or should be called only once as initializer.

For the depositors it creates risks. In case if people deposit to UXDController and minted redeemable1, it's possible that owner will change redeemable to redeemable2. So when people will try to redeem their redeemable1 using controller the tx will revert and user will lost their funds as they will not be able to redeem them ever.
## Impact
Lost of funds for depositors.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove `setRedeemable` function and provide redeemable in `initialize` function. Or make `setRedeemable` be callable only once.
