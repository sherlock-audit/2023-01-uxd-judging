# Change of redeemable will break the system

## Summary
An admin can set a new redeemable token but not the whole system adjusts to that.

## Vulnerability Detail
```UXDController``` stores a reference to the redeemable token and this reference can be updated at any time by an owner:
```solidity
    function setRedeemable(address _redeemable) external onlyOwner {
        if (!_redeemable.isContract()) {
            revert CtrlAddressNotContract(_redeemable);
        }
        redeemable = IRedeemable(_redeemable);
    }
```
One potential problem is that if redeemable is changed after users have already minted some, then they will no longer be able to burn old redeemable and withdraw the underlying asset.

Another problem is that ```RageDnDepository``` loads the redeemable only once (when initializing):
```solidity
    function initialize(address _vault, address _controller) external virtual initializer {
        ...
        redeemable = address(controller.redeemable());
    }
```
Later it uses this cached reference and does not assume potential changes.

## Impact
If the redeemable token is changed, the Controller mint and burn functions, and other contracts that rely on it might start misbehaving, e.g. when calculating decimals.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider if ```setRedeemable``` is really necessary and if so, adjust the system accordingly to react to potential changes.
