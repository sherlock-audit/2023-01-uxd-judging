# [NAZ-M3] If Asset is No Longer Listed Users Can't Redeem

## Summary
Users can be blocked from redeeming if the asset is no longer listed.

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently `UXDController.sol` implements features to add & remove asset token from a whitelist. If users where to deposit and that asset token were to be removed they would no longer be able to withdraw until it is added again.

## Impact
Users will be locked out of withdrawing their assets and force them to wait for the asset token to be added again.

## Code Snippet
[`UXDController.sol#L316`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDController.sol#L316)

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider removing this check so that even if the asset is removed users will still be able to withdraw.
