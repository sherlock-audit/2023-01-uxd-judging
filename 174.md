# Unbounded loops could lead to DOS of the contract

## Summary
There are plenty of places in the code where the developers use a for loop and iterate over unbounded arrays.
Even though the arrays can be changed only by the owner, it's still very dangerous and could lead to a DOS (Denial of Service) of the contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol keeps track of the assets using both a `mapping(address => bool) whitelistedAssets` and an unbounded array `assetList`.
The `whitelistAsset()` function in the `UXDController.sol` contract allows an admin to add ERC20 tokens as whitelisted assets of the protocol, it modifies the mapping and adds / removed item from the array.

As there is no function in Solidity to remove an item from an array on a certain index, the developer decided to loop over the whole array to find the asset index, here is the code snippet:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDController.sol#L144-L148
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDController.sol#L155-L160

This is a very bad approach and in case there will be too many assets (which is likely to be in the future), the loop will be huge and the `whitelistAsset` will always run out of gas because of the `_addAsset` and `_removeAsset` for loops.

Similar problem exist in the `UXDRouter.sol` contract as well.

## Impact
Denial of service to the `whitelistAsset` function and inability to modify the protocols supported assets.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use mappings instead of unbounded arrays.
There is no reason to hold the supported assets both in a mapping and an array.
Using only a mapping would also simplify the `whitelistAsset` function, avoid the `_addAsset` and `_removeAsset` functionality which adds complication to the code and opens a surface for bugs and mistakes.
