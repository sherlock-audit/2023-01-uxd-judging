# Using the onlyOwner modifier can potentially cause a loss in some cases

## Summary
The `onlyOwner` modifier in the provided code restricts the `_authorizeUpgrade` function to only be callable by the contract's owner. This means that only the account that deployed the contract will be able to call this function.

Using the `onlyOwner` modifier can potentially cause a loss in some cases

## Vulnerability Detail
At https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDController.sol#L357

```
    function _authorizeUpgrade(address)
        internal
        virtual
        override
        onlyOwner
    // solhint-disable-next-line no-empty-blocks
    {}
```
## Impact
For example, if the contract owner loses access to their account (for example, if they lose their private keys), they will no longer be able to call the `_authorizeUpgrade` function or any other function with the `onlyOwner` modifier. This could prevent the contract from being upgraded or maintained, which could have negative consequences depending on the purpose of the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set a multisig as the owner and use a timelock.

It is therefore important for a contract's owner to carefully consider the potential risks and consequences of using the onlyOwner modifier before using it in their contract. In some cases, it may be more appropriate to use a different mechanism for controlling access to certain functions, such as using a multisig contract or a contract with multiple authorized accounts.
