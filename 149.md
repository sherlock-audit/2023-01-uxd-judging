# An attacker can flashloan the protocol  and take out alot  of the collateral witch  then makes that position margin called

## Summary
An attacker can get a flash loan and use it on the protocol and then since the attacker is redeeming the collateral from the position there is a chance that the whole position will get liquidated.
## Vulnerability Detail
Since the protocol uses an allowance  way of transferring funds an attacker can get a lot of udx and then transfer it all to the protocol taking out the collateral, if the position is  in a bad state the collateral left will be liquidated and users will lose their funds 
## Impact
Loss of funds:
ex:
1 ether in the perp dispensary  of shorts and long and 2300 usdc of collateral
Alice(attacker)  flash loans  2300 udx
They redeem when the positions  are  negative(taking a loss)
The collateral is redeemed and since there is no collateral remaining and it needs to have collateral to stay alive but if it can't, the position will get liquidated and users will lose 1 ether in the position.
Then the attacker can do this over and over and cause the protocol loss.
  
## Code Snippet
```solidity 
    function redeem(
        address assetToken,
        uint256 redeemAmount,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
        address receiver
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
        InternalRedeemParams memory rp = InternalRedeemParams({
            assetToken: assetToken,
            amountToRedeem: redeemAmount,
            minAmountOut: minAmountOut,
            intermediary: receiver
        });
        uint256 amountOut = _redeem(rp);
        emit Redeemed(msg.sender, receiver, amountOut);
        return amountOut;
    }
// _redeem()
  if(redeemable.allowance(msg.sender, address(this)) < redeemParams.amountToRedeem) {
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
With a large amount of udx out on the market: Implement a fee that is a token on the redeeming which can cause more loss for the attacker or make sure the collateral for the position are separate enough and one can't touch the other position.
