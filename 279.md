# Funds can be locked in `Uniswapper` after swapping

## Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/uniswap/Uniswapper.sol#L24

## Vulnerability Detail
Function `swapExactInput()` interacts with Uniswap V3 to do the swap. It is called from `rebalance()` and has this flow.
1. Input token transferred to `Uniswapper`.
2. `Uniswapper` approved to Uniswap V3 router.
3. Call to UniV3 Router to do the swap.

However, Uniswap V3 is not guaranteed that it will used all amount of token approved to it. In fact, if attacker set value for `sqrtPriceLimitX96`, it will stop swap if price touch this price limit even `amountIn` is not fully used.

As the result, left over funds is locked in `Uniswapper` contract since it is already transferred there.

## Impact
Funds of users is locked in `Uniswapper`.

## Code Snippet
Check out the code for function `exactInputSingle()` in Uniswap V3 Router

It call to `swap()` in Pool Core contract and did not have any check that `amountIn` has to be used fully
