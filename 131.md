# Being onlyOwner and malicious owner can cause problem

## Summary
 Malicious owner can cause problem abort if the value of newMintCap is zero or less.

## Vulnerability Detail
At https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDToken.sol#L95
    function setLocalMintCap(uint256 newMintCap) external onlyOwner {

## Impact
The onlyOwner modifier to protect a contract's critical functions may not be sufficient, as the contract owner could potentially act maliciously or make mistakes that could lead to unintended consequences. It is generally a good idea to use multiple layers of security and control in a contract, such as using a multiSig wallet or a timeLock, to help ensure the safety and integrity of the contract.

## Code Snippet
`    function setLocalMintCap(uint256 newMintCap) external onlyOwner {`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set a multisig as the owner and use a timelock.
