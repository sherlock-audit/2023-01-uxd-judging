# Lack of method to update the voting token in governance contract

## Summary

Either UXDCouncilToken or UXP token cannot be used as governance token.

## Vulnerability Detail

In Gonvernace section of the code, there are two ERC20 token, both token can be used as voting token in UXDGovernor contract.

```solidity
contract UXDCouncilToken is Ownable, ERC20, ERC20Permit, ERC20Votes {
```

and

```solidity
contract UXPToken is Ownable, OFT, ERC20Permit, ERC20Votes {
```

Note the constructor of the UXGovernor.

```solidity
contract UXDGovernor is
    ReentrancyGuard,
    Governor,
    GovernorVotes,
    GovernorVotesQuorumFraction,
    GovernorTimelockControl,
    GovernorCountingSimple,
    GovernorSettings
{
    ///         Errors
    error GovERC20ApprovalFailed(address token, address to, uint256 amount);
    error GovERC20TransferFailed(address token, address to, uint256 amount);

    constructor(IVotes _token, TimelockController _timelock, GovernorParams memory _params)
        Governor("UXDGovernor")
        GovernorVotes(_token)
        GovernorSettings(_params.votingDelay, _params.votingPeriod, _params.proposalThreshold)
        GovernorVotesQuorumFraction(_params.quorumFraction)
        GovernorTimelockControl(_timelock)
    {}
```

note the parameter IVotes _token.

According to the message from discord

> UXP is the public governance token. However, at initial launch the governance will be controlled by the UXDCouncilToken minted to team members and other internal stakeholders. Once UXP has been widely distributed to the point where no one party controls a huge portion of the supply, ownership of the protocol will be transferred to UXP and governance decisions will be taken through the public token.

However, the UXDGovernor inherits from GovernorVotes

https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/governance/extensions/GovernorVotes.sol

the token address is immutable.

```solidity
abstract contract GovernorVotes is Governor {
    IVotes public immutable token;

    constructor(IVotes tokenAddress) {
        token = tokenAddress;
    }
```

These means that once the UXD council token is set as the voting token, UXP token cannot be used as voting token.

## Impact

I do not think redeploying the governor contract can solve the issue, consider there can be pending open proposal and ongoing voting using the old Council token.

Also, it is likely the user need to put real money and buy the council token to vote, 

If governor contract is redeployed, the council token is suddenly worthless and result in loss of fund for those people who bought the council token.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the project not make the token immutable to let the governance update the voting token once there is no active proposal and those bought the old council voting otken needs to be well compensated.
