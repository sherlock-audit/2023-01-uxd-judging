# A whale user can launch governance majority attack if he controls a large amount of voting token supply

## Summary

A whale user can launch governance attack manipulation if he controls a large amount of token supply

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation of the UXDGovernor

```solidity
contract UXDGovernor is
    ReentrancyGuard,
    Governor,
    GovernorVotes,
    GovernorVotesQuorumFraction,
    GovernorTimelockControl,
    GovernorCountingSimple,
    GovernorSettings
{
    ///         Errors
    error GovERC20ApprovalFailed(address token, address to, uint256 amount);
    error GovERC20TransferFailed(address token, address to, uint256 amount);

    constructor(IVotes _token, TimelockController _timelock, GovernorParams memory _params)
        Governor("UXDGovernor")
        GovernorVotes(_token)
        GovernorSettings(_params.votingDelay, _params.votingPeriod, _params.proposalThreshold)
        GovernorVotesQuorumFraction(_params.quorumFraction)
        GovernorTimelockControl(_timelock)
    {}
```

If the voting power pass a threshold quorum fraction threshold, a proposal can be created and then if a user has enough voting power, he can vote the queue the proposal and get the proposal executed.

Either the voting token is the UXD council token or the UXP token,

If a whale user use a large amount of fund purchase token and control the majority of the token supply, he can create malicious proposal and launch majority attack to modify cricial smart contract state, such as whitelist malicious token or block good token or performance malicious smart contract upgrade the rug other users.

## Impact

governance majority attack can manipulate the smart contract state.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a veto role to let the governance veto the proposal to avoid whale user's majority attack.
