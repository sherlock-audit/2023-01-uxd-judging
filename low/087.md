# Not calling `approve(0)` before setting a new approval may cause the call to revert

## Summary

There are instances where the `IERC20.approve()` function is called only once without setting the allowance to zero. Some tokens, like USDT , require first reducing the address’ allowance to zero by calling `IERC20(assetToken).approve(address(vault), 0);` .

## Vulnerability Detail

There are instances where the `IERC20.approve()` function is called only once without setting the allowance to zero. Some tokens, like USDT , require first reducing the address’ allowance to zero by calling `IERC20(assetToken).approve(address(vault), 0);` .

Contracts affected include: `RageDnDepository, PerpDepository`

This would affect depositories that use asset tokens that require setting the allowance to zero. 

## Impact

Transactions will revert when using an unsupported token like USDT.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use `IERC20(assetToken).approve(address(vault), 0);` before each of the existing `approve()` calls.
Alternatively Use `OpenZeppelin’s SafeERC20 ’s safeTransfer()` instead.
