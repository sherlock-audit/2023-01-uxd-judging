# Transfering non standard ERC20 could fail without revert

## Summary

Transferring non-standard ERC20 could fail without revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

It's possible to mint UXD tokens without spending non-standard ERC20 tokens with non-reverting transfers.
On [UXDController.sol#L195](https://github.com/UXDProtocol/uxd-evm/blob/sherlock-audit/contracts/core/UXDController.sol#L195) a token XYZ with non-reverting transfers, if added to the whitelist of tokens, can fail to transfer due to a balance/approval not being sufficient. The execution of the code will continue and reach the mint function minting UXD tokens without any XYZ being transferred.
 
 A similar issue exists in [PerpDepository.sol#L626](https://github.com/UXDProtocol/uxd-evm/blob/sherlock-audit/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L626) with the possibility for an attacker to drain assets.
 
 For example [lido](https://etherscan.io/token/0x5a98fcbea516cf06857215779fd812ca3bef1b32#code) transferFrom returns false without a failing transaction if allowance isn't sufficient.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
collateral.transferFrom(
            account,
            depository,
            assetAmount
        );

        InternalMintParams memory mintParams = InternalMintParams({
            assetToken: assetToken,
            assetAmount: assetAmount,
            minAmountOut: minAmountOut,
            receiver: receiver,
            depository: depository
        });
        return _mint(mintParams);
```
