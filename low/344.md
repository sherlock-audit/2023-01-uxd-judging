# Tokens not compliant with ERC-20 will cause transfers and approvals to revert unexpectedly

## Summary

Non-standard ERC-20 (e.g. `USDT`) tokens will break the `transfer`/`approve` functionality in the `UXDTimelockController` and `UXDGovernor` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

Some tokens (like `USDT`, see [L126](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code)) don't correctly implement the `EIP20` standard and their `transfer`/`transferFrom/approve` functions return `void` instead of a success boolean. Calling these functions with the expectation of having a boolean value returned will cause the transaction to revert.

## Impact

The `UXDTimelockController` and `UXDGovernor` contracts will not be able to `transfer` or `approve` non-standard ERC-20 tokens that don't return a boolean value.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider using the `TransferHelper` library consistently throughout the codebase to ensure that all ERC-20 transfers and approvals are handled correctly.
