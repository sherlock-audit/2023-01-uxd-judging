# UXDController._redeem and mint incompatible with tokens like ZRX, HT and WOO. Alternatively, incompatible with USDT

## Summary
Tokens like ZRX and HT does not revert on transfer.
Tokens like STA cuts fee at transfer.
Tokens like USDT doenst return a value at transfer.

Contract uses transfer() and transferFrom() without 1) checking the return value, 2) doesn't take into account that there might not be a return value or 3) if the token is deflationary/ takes fee. 

## Vulnerability Detail
When using e.g. transferFrom() with tokens like ZRX, if the transactions fails it simply returns a false bool. Meaning the function completes without having the tokens transferred. 
## Impact
Protocol might not receive assets when using .mint or user might not receive assets when using .redeem.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom from OZ AND check for balance before and after transfer. 

Do note that implementing a require only will make the contract incompatible with tokens like ZRX but not STA and USDT since it takes fees or does not return a value at all.
