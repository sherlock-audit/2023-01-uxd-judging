# Check that `assetToken` is whitelisted in the external function instead of the internal one

## Summary
The `assetToken` param input whitelist check could be moved from an internal to external function to save gas.

## Vulnerability Detail
When user wishes to mint UXD using the external `mint` or `mintWithETH` functions in the `UXDController.sol` contract, some logic happens in the external function and then it calls the internal `_mint` function.
The check wether the assets that the user wants to deposit is whitelisted happens in the internal function which is problematic for two reasons:
1) In case the `mintWithETH` called the internal `_mint()` function - there is no reason to check that WETH is whitelisted, because it surely is.
2) In case the `mint` function called the internal `_mint()` function - a lot of opcodes could be save if we would check if the asset is whitelisted in the beginning of the external `mint` function.

## Impact
Bad logic which leads to unnecessary gas spend for the users.

## Recommendation
Move the whitelist check form the internal `_mint` function to the beginning of the external `mint` function.
