# Should use safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom instead of transfer/transferFrom

## Summary
Calling transfer/transferFrom ERC20 without checking if it succeeds is very risky.
## Vulnerability Detail
It is good to add a require() statement that checks the return value of token transfers or to use something like OpenZeppelinâ€™s safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom unless one is sure the given token reverts in case of a failure. Failure to do so will cause silent failures of transfers and affect token accounting in contract.
## Impact
In some cases, transfer/transferFrom without checking can lead to tokens being transferred fail but it will not revert. It is very dangerous to the protocol.
