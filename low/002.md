# Net amount of minted UXD Token can exceed max amount that can be minted on a chain

## Summary
Due to absence of some validation in ```setLocalMintCap()``` function ```localMintAmount```(Net amount minted on this chain) could exceed ```localMintCap```(max amount that can be minted on this chain).

## Vulnerability Detail
While setting ```localMintCap``` by Owner via ```setLocalMintCap()``` function, function only check the input parameter ```newMintCap``` must be greater than zero. But there is no condition check whether ```newMintCap``` is greater than ```localMintAmount```

Consider a senario where already minting for ```UXD Token``` started, so ```localMintAmount``` will be a non-zero value and Owner change Maximum minting cap value and assign a new Cap value less than ```localMintAmount```, That will cause damage to code base.

## Impact
Minting amount of token exceed the max cap amount of token for a chain.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
File : contracts/core/UXDToken.sol

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDToken.sol#L95-L100
```
```solidity
    function setLocalMintCap(uint256 newMintCap) external onlyOwner { // @audit
        require(newMintCap > 0, "Zero Amount");
        localMintCap = newMintCap;

        emit LocalMintCapChanged(msg.sender, localMintCap);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation 
There already a function ```_checkLocalMint()``` defined in that code base that checking whether ```localMintAmount > localMintCap```,
So you have to only include that function inside ```setLocalMintCap()``` function
