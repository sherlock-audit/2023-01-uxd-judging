# The protocol lacks contract/function pause safeguards

## Summary

The protocol has not implemented any way to pause various functions incase of a critical issue.

## Vulnerability Detail

It is important to be able to pause certain critical functionality when the need arises. There's always the possibility that risks such as an attacker attempting to drain the protocol occur. Without pause functionality, it would be difficult to safeguard the protocol in such scenarios. Functions such as mint and redeem should include pausing safeguards.

## Impact

The protocol could lose funds or cease to operate if emergency actions aren't taken such as pausing various functions when an exploit is detected.
