# User might not know that they have not voted

## Summary
The voting power requires users to delegate to themselves to activate the voting power from their tokens. However, users might not know this and call `castVote` thinking that they have voted but their voting power are not counted.

## Vulnerability Detail
According to [ERC20Votes](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc20#ERC20Votes) docs. By default, token balance does not account for voting power. This makes transfers cheaper. The downside is that it requires users to delegate to themselves in order to activate checkpoints and have their voting power tracked.

```solidity
    function delegate(address delegatee) public virtual override {
        _delegate(_msgSender(), delegatee);
    }
```
If user did not call  `delegate(user_address)`, their votes will not be counted. Hence, users that do not know this will call `castVote` without knowing that their votes did not count. It will also be harder to realise this problem as others might have delegated their voting power to them and further convolutes their voting power amount.

## Impact

User votes are not counted.

## Recommendation

Consider delegating to themselves when receiving council tokens if their `delegates` returns 0 address.
