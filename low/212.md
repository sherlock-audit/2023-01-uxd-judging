# [NAZ-M6] `redeemableSoftCap` is Not Set on Deployment And Can Cause Early Users To Not be Able To Deposit

## Summary
Early Users won't be able to deposit because `redeemableSoftCap` is not set on deployment.

## Vulnerability Detail
In both `PerpDepository.sol && RageDnDepository.sol` there are `redeemableSoftCap`s used to cap the users on their deposits. However, this is not set on initialization and would cause early users to revert on their deposits.

## Impact
Early users would waste gas and time trying to deposit early because the `redeemableSoftCap`s are not set on initialization.

## Code Snippet
[`PerpDepository.sol#L164`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L164), [`RageDnDepository.sol#L91`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/rage-trade/RageDnDepository.sol#L91)

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider setting `redeemableSoftCap` on initialization to prevent early users from wasting gas and time.
