# UXDToken mint and burn function could become unusable

## Summary
UXDToken.mint and .burn have the "onlyController" modifier which only allows the "immutable controller" (UXDController) to be able to call the functions. It's not possible to change the "controller" address because 1) it's immutable 2) there's no function that can do that. If e.g. an exploit of the UXDController would occur, the mint and burn function becomes unavailable.
