# Lack of 2 Step Ownership change for the `transferOwnership` function

## Summary
 The `transferOwnership` function of the RageDnDepository.sol and PerpDepository.sol files lacks 2 step ownership change. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `transferOwnership` function of the RageDnDepository.sol and PerpDepository.sol files lacks 2 step ownership change. The RageDnDepository contracts inherits from the OwnableUpgradeable which has a single step ownership change. This single step ownership change immediately changes the owner to the newOwner address passed as argument to the function. This single step ownership change is succeptible to irrecoverable error in situation where the owner mistakenly pass a wrong address as the new owner making the onlyOwner functions useless. A zero address check also need to be done.
 
 ```jsx
function transferOwnership(address newOwner)
        public
        override(IDepository, OwnableUpgradeable)
        onlyOwner
    {
        super.transferOwnership(newOwner);
    }
```
single step implemented in the base OwnableUpgradable contract
```jsx
function _transferOwnership(address newOwner) internal virtual {
        address oldOwner = _owner;
        _owner = newOwner;
        emit OwnershipTransferred(oldOwner, newOwner);
    }

```
## Impact
When the current owner mistakenly sets the new owner with a wrongly copied address, the function immediately sets the new owner which becomes irrecoverable.
```jsx
function _transferOwnership(address newOwner) internal virtual {
        address oldOwner = _owner;
        _owner = newOwner;
        emit OwnershipTransferred(oldOwner, newOwner);
    }

```

        _owner = newOwner;
        emit OwnershipTransferred(oldOwner, newOwner);
    }

```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the 2 step ownership change process like the openzeppelin's 2-step Ownable contract so that the newowner address accepts ownership by sending a transaction to the network.

see: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable2Step.sol

```jsx
function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public virtual override onlyOwner {
        _pendingOwner = newOwner;
        emit OwnershipTransferStarted(owner(), newOwner);
    }

    /**
     * @dev Transfers ownership of the contract to a new account (`newOwner`) and deletes any pending owner.
     * Internal function without access restriction.
     */
    function _transferOwnership(address newOwner) internal virtual override {
        delete _pendingOwner;
        super._transferOwnership(newOwner);
    }

    /**
     * @dev The new owner accepts the ownership transfer.
     */
    function acceptOwnership() external {
        address sender = _msgSender();
        require(pendingOwner() == sender, "Ownable2Step: caller is not the new owner");
        _transferOwnership(sender);
    }
```
