# Use `SafeERC20` for approve, transfer and transferFrom

## Summary

Unsafe Transfers or approval doesn't revert on failure and without checks on its return value, contract will consider it as Successful.

## Vulnerability Detail

approve(), transfer() and transferFrom() can fail for certain token implementations that do not return a boolean value. They also doesn't revert but return false on failure. The instances listed below doesn't have a check on the return value which means the code always "Considers" it to be successful irrespective of the reality. Hence it is recommend to use safeApprove().

## Impact

Loss of funds.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol

197:          IERC20(insuranceToken()).transferFrom(from, address(this), amount);
198:          IERC20(insuranceToken()).approve(address(vault), amount);
220:          IERC20(insuranceToken()).transfer(to, amount);
286:          IERC20(assetToken).approve(address(vault), amount);
301:          IERC20(assetToken).transfer(to, amount);
394:          IERC20(quoteToken).approve(address(vault), quoteAmount);
512:          IERC20(quoteToken).transferFrom(
519:          IERC20(quoteToken).transfer(
626:          IERC20(quoteToken).transferFrom(account, address(this), amount);
627:          IERC20(quoteToken).approve(address(vault), amount);
639:          IERC20(assetToken).transfer(account, baseAmount);

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use OpenZeppelinâ€™s `SafeERC20` library and change `transfer` to `safeTransfer`, `transferFrom` to `safeTransferFrom` and `approve` to `safeApprove`
