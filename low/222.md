# use abi.encodeCall instead of abi.encodeWithSelector

## Summary
using abi.encodeWithSelector isnt type safe, the function will still execute with the wrong data types 
## Vulnerability Detail
if you pass in the wrong data types when using abi.encodeWithSelector the function will still run to completion and not return an error even though it failed.
## Impact
the expected results wont appear because you wont be able to tell if the function worked or not
