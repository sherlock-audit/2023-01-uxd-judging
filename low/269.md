# softCap does not judge whether it is 0

## Summary
softCap does not judge whether it is 0
## Vulnerability Detail
In contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol, there is a judgment on softcap
```solidity
function setRedeemableSoftCap(uint256 softCap) external onlyOwner {
  if (softCap == 0) {
      revert ZeroAmount();
  }
  redeemableSoftCap = softCap;

  emit RedeemableSoftCapUpdated(msg.sender, softCap);
}
```

However, in contracts/integrations/rage-trade/RageDnDepository.sol, there is no 0 value judgment for softcap

```solidity
function setRedeemableSoftCap(uint256 softCap) external onlyOwner {
        redeemableSoftCap = softCap; //@audit  
        emit RedeemableSoftCapUpdated(msg.sender, softCap);
}
```

          }
        redeemableSoftCap = softCap; //@audit  
        emit RedeemableSoftCapUpdated(msg.sender, softCap);
