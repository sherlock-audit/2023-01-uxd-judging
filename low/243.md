# Result of ERC20.transfer does not get checked

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
In UXDController, a user can call `redeem()` will return assetTokens, which is done by calling `transfer()`. Although Openzeppelin tokens revert on failure, some tokens do not and return a boolean value. In the interest of supporting other tokens in the future, UXD should consider checking the results from `IERC20(redeemParams.assetToken).transfer()`.

## Impact
Redeemers may burn their redeem tokens, but not receive their asset back if the call to `transfer()` fails.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check to make sure the asset is transferred
```solidity
bool transferred = IERC20(redeemParams.assetToken).transfer(redeemParams.intermediary, amountOut);
require(transferred, "Asset transfer failed");
```
