# [NAZ-M5] Calling `redeemForEth()` Can Revert If Receiver Input Corresponds To A Contract That is Unable To Receive ETH Through Its `receive()/fallback()`

## Summary
Users who are redeeming for ETH using a contract that doesn't implement `receive()/fallback()` will have their calls to `redeemForEth()` revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
The following `redeemForEth()` function is called when a user is attempting to redeem their `redeemable` token for ETH. If the receiver input for the `redeemForEth()` function corresponds to a contract, it is possible that the receiver contract does not, intentionally or unintentionally, implement the `receive()/fallback()` functions in a way that supports receiving ETH or that calling the receiver contract's `receive()/fallback()` functions executes complicated logics that cost much gas, which could cause calling `redeemForEth()` to revert.

## Impact
This will prevent the user from being able to redeem their tokens for ETH.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
When calling the `redeemForEth()` function, if the receiver contract is unable to receive ETH through its `receive()/fallback()` function, use WETH to be transferred to the receiver contract.
