# Lacking of minting total supply boundary check for UXP token

## Summary

Lacking of minting total supply boundary check for UXP token

## Vulnerability Detail

According to the tokenomic documentation of UXP token

https://docs.uxd.fi/uxdprotocol/overview/uxp-token-economics

The total supply is 

Total Supply: 7,000,000,000 UXP

However, there is no such total supply limitation in the UXP token code

```solidity
contract UXPToken is Ownable, OFT, ERC20Permit, ERC20Votes {

    error NotApproved(uint256 allowance, uint256 spendAmount);

    /// @notice Constructor
    /// @dev Explain to a developer any extra details
    /// @param custodian Address to mint initial supply to if > 0
    /// @param initialTotalSupply Initial supply. Minted to `custodian`.
    /// @param lzEndpoint LayerZero endpoint 
    constructor(address custodian, uint256 initialTotalSupply, address lzEndpoint) OFT("UXD Governance Token", "UXP", lzEndpoint) ERC20Permit("UXP") {
        if (initialTotalSupply != 0) {
            _mint(custodian, initialTotalSupply);
        }
    }

    /// @notice Mint new tokens to an address
    /// @dev Can only be called by owner.
    /// @param account the address to mint to
    /// @param amount the amount to mint
    function mint(address account, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        _mint(account, amount);
    }
```

The owner or the governance can mint whatever amount of token they like and can exceed and bypass the 7,000,000,000 UXP token supply threshold.

## Impact

If the token total supply bypass the 7,000,000,000 UXP token supply threshold, both user and investor will be unhappy because their tokekn market share iare dulited and the tokenomic is broken and violated.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the project add the  7,000,000,000 UXP token supply upper limit in smart contract to ensure the tokenomic not violated or update the documentation to acknowledge that the total supply is subject to change by governance with great caution.
