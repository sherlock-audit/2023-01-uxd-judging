# funds can be lost forever

## Summary
As we can see, Owner is capable to set the depository address for existing `assetToken`, it can be mistakenly set to the address(0), which have consequences as protocol grows in future, However owner can register new depository of `assetToken` and unregister the fault one, but maybe its too late to doing so. 

## Vulnerability Detail
If the owner set the depository address for the `assetToken` mistakenly address(0), as there is no check for address(0), `findDepositoryForDeposit` will return address(0) for entered assetToken. In consequences, funds will transfer to the address(0) and lost forever.
## Impact
fund will be lost forever to address(0)

## Recommendation

Consider adding if check

```solidity

   error InvalidAddress(); 
    
    ...

    function _checkDepositoriesForAsset(
        address assetToken,
        address checkFor
    ) internal view returns (address) {
        if (checkFor== address(0)) {
            revert InvalidAddress();
        }
        address[] storage byAsset = _depositoriesForAsset[assetToken];
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < byAsset.length; i++) {
            if (byAsset[i] == checkFor) {
                return byAsset[i];
            }
        }
        return address(0);
    }
```
