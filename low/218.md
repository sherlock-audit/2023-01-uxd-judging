# Excess eth is not refunded

## Summary
The UXDController contract requires sender to provide eth(msg.value) for mintWithEth call. Now if user has provided more eth than combined call.value then this excess eth is not refunded back to user.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Navigate to contracts/core/UXDController.sol
2. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDController.sol#L213
3. As mintWithEth function is payable user can pay eth for function call.
4. But excess amount of eth is not refunded back to user.

## Impact
1. Loss of eth for user
2. eth might get stuck in contract

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function mintWithEth(uint256 minAmountOut, address receiver)
        external
        payable
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256)
    {
        uint256 amount = msg.value;
        address collateral = weth;
        address depository = router.findDepositoryForDeposit(
            collateral,
            amount
        );

        // Deposit ETH with WETH contract and mint WETH
        IWETH9(weth).deposit{value: amount}();
        bool transferred = IERC20(weth).transfer(depository, amount);
        require(transferred, "WETH transfer failed");
        InternalMintParams memory mintParams = InternalMintParams({
            assetToken: collateral,
            assetAmount: msg.value,
            minAmountOut: minAmountOut,
            receiver: receiver,
            depository: depository
        });
        return _mint(mintParams);
    }
```
