# UXDGovernor and UXDTimelockController cannot transfer or approve non standard tokens

## Summary
Contracts `UXDGovernor` and `UXDTimelockController` require that functions `approve` and `transfer` return true. This means the treasury will not be able to use non-standard ERC20 tokens if they're ever sent to these contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail
Functions `approveERC20` and `transferERC20` in `UXDTimelockController` and `UXDGovernor` contracts are defined like this:
**UXDGovernor**
```solidity
function approveERC20(
	address token,
	address spender,
	uint256 amount
) external onlyGovernance {
	if (!(IERC20(token).approve(spender, amount))) {
		revert GovERC20ApprovalFailed(token, spender, amount);
	}
}
```

```solidity
function transferERC20(
	address token,
	address to,
	uint256 amount
) external onlyGovernance nonReentrant {
	if (!(IERC20(token).transfer(to, amount))) {
		revert GovERC20TransferFailed(token, to, amount);
	}
}
```

**UXDTimelockController**
```solidity
function approveERC20(address token, address spender, uint256 amount) external onlySelf {
	if (!(IERC20(token).approve(spender, amount))) {
		revert TimelockERC20ApprovalFailed(token, spender, amount);
	}
}
```
```solidity
function transferERC20(address token, address to, uint256 amount) external onlySelf nonReentrant  {
	if (!(IERC20(token).transfer(to, amount))) {
		revert TimelockERC20TransferFailed(token, to, amount);
	}
}
```
They all check that the execution of the external call to the token contract return true, otherwise they revert.
But there are quite some tokens, like for instance USDT, that don't return a boolean (thus not fully adhering to the ERC20 standard) and, although they could be sent to these two contracts, they could only be transferred out of it by executing a governance proposal in the case of `UXDTimelockController`, but for  `UXDGovernor` these tokens would be stuck in the contract forever, as there would be no way to transfer them out.

## Impact
High impact.
