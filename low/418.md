# MaxCap(maximum amount of token that can be minted) can set below number of token minted by now

## Summary
can Current mining amount will exceed max capped value

## Vulnerability Detail
Here below function ```setLocalMintCap()``` only called by owner, setting ``` localMintCap``` to a new value.
It checks whether new value is 0 or not,
But there is absence of check whether ```newMintCap``` is greater than ```localMintAmount``` or not,
If owner set wrong value i.e(```newMintCap``` < ```localMintAmount```) then current minting amount exceed the capped value
Which cause logic break

```solidity
function setLocalMintCap(uint256 newMintCap) external onlyOwner { // @audit-issue
        require(newMintCap > 0, "Zero Amount");
        localMintCap = newMintCap;

        emit LocalMintCapChanged(msg.sender, localMintCap);
    }
```

## Impact
May cause some logic break, technical current minting amount exceed max capped minting value

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There should be functionality (or require) that checks ```newMintCap``` should greater than ```localMintAmount```
