# Validate critical input parameters

## Summary

In the current UXD implementation, there are certain places the input parameters are used without validation.

Since they are very critical in nature when we look at the places, I would like to flag them as medium.

## Vulnerability Detail

Following places lacks the input validation checks. if they are missed, it would bring unexpected results.

UXPToken.sol#L21-L25 - minting of tokens takes place to custodian address

    constructor(address custodian, uint256 initialTotalSupply, address lzEndpoint) OFT("UXD Governance Token", "UXP", lzEndpoint) ERC20Permit("UXP") {
        if (initialTotalSupply != 0) {
            _mint(custodian, initialTotalSupply);
        }
    }

RageDnDepository.sol - softCap should be > 0. 

    function setRedeemableSoftCap(uint256 softCap) external onlyOwner {
        redeemableSoftCap = softCap;
        emit RedeemableSoftCapUpdated(msg.sender, softCap);
    }

When the Perp has this check by considering the level of importance, Rage is missing.

Below is the Perp implementation :

    function setRedeemableSoftCap(uint256 softCap) external onlyOwner {
        if (softCap == 0) {
            revert ZeroAmount();
        }
        redeemableSoftCap = softCap;


        emit RedeemableSoftCapUpdated(msg.sender, softCap);
    }



## Impact

1. UXP could be minted to invalid address.
2. zero soft cap would help to mint more number of UXP token.
