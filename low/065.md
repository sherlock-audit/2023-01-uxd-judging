# No one can claim profit if Admin revokes

## Summary
If Admin revokes the ownership then no one is allowed to withdraw the profit and the profit amount will remain stuck in contract
The same issue is also valid for `withdrawInsurance` function

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Owner revokes the ownership by calling `transferOwnership` function with new owner as `address(0)`

```solidity
function transferOwnership(address newOwner)
        public
        override(IDepository, OwnableUpgradeable)
        onlyOwner
    {
        super.transferOwnership(newOwner);
    }
```

2. Now `withdrawProfits` function cannot be called as this function can only be called by Owner

```solidity
function withdrawProfits(address receiver) external onlyOwner nonReentrant {
...
}
```

3. This means noone can claim the profit

## Impact
If Owner revokes the ownership then noone can claim the profit and the amount will remain stuck in contract

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Since `withdrawProfits` always need an Owner to be alive, it is recommended to revise `transferOwnership` function to disallow `address(0)`

```solidity
function transferOwnership(address newOwner)
        public
        override(IDepository, OwnableUpgradeable)
        onlyOwner
    {
require(newOwner!=address(0), "Invalid address");
        super.transferOwnership(newOwner);
    }
```
