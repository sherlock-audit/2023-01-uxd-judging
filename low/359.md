# [M-02] Unsafe Token Transfers

## Summary

The `UXDController` and  `PerpDepository` contracts make use of the unsafe `transfer()` and `transferFrom()` functions of the standard `ERC20` contract without checking the return values. 

In case the `ERC-20` tokens that ***do not revert transactions on transfer failures*** are whitelisted as collateral assets (for minting the `UXD` token), several unexpected behaviors can occur, leading to potential attack vectors to the protocol.

**From my inspection, I discovered that the UXD protocol relies on the security protection mechanisms of other integrated protocols (e.g., `Perpetual Protocol`). If the integrated protocols fail to handle errors, the assets managed by the UXD protocol could be at risk.**

## Vulnerability Detail

I detected that the `UXDController` and  `PerpDepository` contracts use the unsafe `ERC20.transfer()` and `ERC20.transferFrom()` functions without checking the return values. That is viable to several potential attack vectors if the `ERC-20` tokens that ***do not revert transactions on transfer failures*** are whitelisted as collateral assets.

To elaborate on the vulnerabilities, consider the following two example scenarios.

#### Example Scenario #1

Snippet 1 presents the functions `PerpDepository.redeem()` (L264 - 278) and `PerpDepository._withdrawAsset()` (L294 - 302). 

During the `UXD` redemption process, the `PerpDepository.redeem()` function would execute the `PerpDepository._withdrawAsset()` function in L270 to withdraw a collateral asset from the `Perpetual Protocol`'s `vault` contract (L300). 

At this point, the `PerpDepository._withdrawAsset()` function relies on the fact that the external `vault` contract must return the expected `amount` of the collateral asset (`assetToken`) back to the `PerpDepository` contract. After that, the `PerpDepository._withdrawAsset()` function would transfer the withdrawn collateral to the `UXDController` contract (L301).

Nonetheless, I noticed that **if the collateral asset is an ERC-20 token that would not revert transactions on transfer failures**. And if the `vault` contract transfers an amount of the collateral asset less than the expected amount, the `PerpDepository._withdrawAsset()` function could not be aware of this fault since the function transfers the withdrawn collateral to the `UXDController` contract using the `ERC20.transfer()` function without checking the return status (L301).

265:        address asset,
266:        uint256 amount
267:    ) external onlyController returns (uint256) {
268:        if (asset == assetToken) {
269:            (uint256 base, ) = _openLong(amount);
270: *          _withdrawAsset(base, address(controller));
271:            return base;
272:        } else if (asset == quoteToken) {
273:            revert QuoteRedeemDisabled(msg.sender);
274:            // return _processQuoteRedeem(amount);
275:        } else {
276:            revert UnsupportedAsset(asset);
277:        }
278:    }

        // ...

294:    function _withdrawAsset(uint256 amount, address to) private {
295:        if (amount > netAssetDeposits) {
296:            revert InsufficientAssetDeposits(netAssetDeposits, amount);
297:        }
298:        netAssetDeposits -= amount;
299:
300: *      vault.withdraw(address(assetToken), amount);
301: *      IERC20(assetToken).transfer(to, amount);
302:    }
```

Snippet 2 shows the `UXDController._redeem()` function. This function would receive the collateral asset from the previous step (L328). Finally, the function would transfer the acquired asset back to a user using the `ERC20.transfer()` function without checking the return status as well (L337). As a result, a user will receive lesser collateral than the expected amount.

312:    function _redeem(InternalRedeemParams memory redeemParams)
313:        internal
314:        returns (uint256)
315:    {

            // ...

328: *      uint256 amountOut = IDepository(depository).redeem(
329:            redeemParams.assetToken, 
330:            redeemParams.amountToRedeem
331:        );
332:
333:        if (amountOut < redeemParams.minAmountOut) {
334:            revert CtrlMinNotMet(redeemParams.minAmountOut, amountOut);
335:        }
336:        redeemable.burn(msg.sender, redeemParams.amountToRedeem);
337: *      IERC20(redeemParams.assetToken).transfer(redeemParams.intermediary, amountOut);
338:
339:        return amountOut;
340:    }
```

Even if the current implementation of the `Perpetual Protocol`'s `vault` contract might guarantee that the `vault` contract will return the correct amount of the collateral asset. Nevertheless, relying on the security protection mechanisms of other integrated protocols is not the best security practice. 

**From my deeper inspection, I discovered that the `vault` is an upgradeable contract (refer to: https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-contract/blob/main/contracts/Vault.sol). If the `vault` contract is somehow upgraded with the unsafe code, the assets managed by the UXD protocol could be at risk.**

#### Example Scenario #2

This scenario is quite similar to `Example Scenario #1`. Suppose the `Perpetual Protocol`'s `vault` contract returns an amount of the collateral asset less than the expected amount (L638 in Snippet 3) while a user rebalances the unrealized PnL. 

In that case, the user will receive lesser collateral than the expected amount since the `PerpDepository._rebalanceNegativePnlLite()` function transfers the withdrawn collateral to the user using the `ERC20.transfer()` function without checking the return status (L639).

615:    function _rebalanceNegativePnlLite(
616:        uint256 amount,
617:        uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96,
618:        address account
619:    ) private returns (uint256, uint256) {

            // ...

630:        bool isShort = false;
631:        bool amountIsInput = true;
632:        (uint256 baseAmount, uint256 quoteAmount) = _placePerpOrder(
633:            normalizedAmount,
634:            isShort,
635:            amountIsInput,
636:            sqrtPriceLimitX96
637:        );
638: *      vault.withdraw(assetToken, baseAmount);
639: *      IERC20(assetToken).transfer(account, baseAmount);
640:
641:        emit Rebalanced(baseAmount, quoteAmount, 0);
642:
643:        return (baseAmount, quoteAmount);
644:    }
```

#### Other Scenarios

Furthermore, there are other scenarios I left discussing here to keep this issue brief.

#### Usages Of Unsafe Token Transfers

The following presents the lists of all lines of code that employ the unsafe `ERC20.transfer()` and `ERC20.transferFrom()` functions without checking the return values.

- **Usages of the unsafe `ERC20.transfer()` function:**
	- L337 in `UXDController._redeem()` function
	- L220 in `PerpDepository.withdrawInsurance()` function
	- L301 in `PerpDepository._withdrawAsset()` function
	- L519 in `PerpDepository._rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap()` function
	- L639 in `PerpDepository._rebalanceNegativePnlLite()` function

- **Usages of the unsafe `ERC20.transferFrom()` function:**
	- L195 in `UXDController.mint()` function
	- L197 in `PerpDepository.depositInsurance()` function
	- L512 in `PerpDepository._rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap()` function
	- L626 in `PerpDepository._rebalanceNegativePnlLite()` function

## Impact

Using the default `ERC20.transfer()` and `ERC20.transferFrom()` functions without checking the return values is unsafe. In the UXD protocol, any `ERC-20` tokens could be collateral assets for minting the `UXD` token (after they are whitelisted, of course).

If the `ERC-20` tokens that ***do not revert transactions on transfer failures*** are whitelisted, several unexpected behaviors can occur, leading to potential attack vectors to the protocol. Some exploitable scenarios are described above in the `Vulnerability Detail` section.

For the likelihood of this vulnerability, I evaluate it as LOW (but it can also be MEDIUM based on the attack vectors and the administration of the protocol). For the impact on assets managed by the protocol, I rate it as MEDIUM (but it can also be HIGH according to the attack vectors gained). For this reason, the risk of this vulnerability is MEDIUM.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I recommend applying the `SafeERC20.safeTransfer()` and `SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom()` functions instead of the default `ERC20.transfer()` and `ERC20.transferFrom()` functions.
