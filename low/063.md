# UXDController#updateController, setRedeemable and whitelistAsset and UXDController#unregisterDepository can be frontrunned

## Summary

UXDController#updateController, setRedeemable and whitelistAsset and UXDController#unregisterDepository can be frontrunned

## Vulnerability Detail

According to the Read me, the on-chain context is:

```solidity
DEPLOYMENT: mainnet, arbitrum, optimism
ERC20: USDC, WETH
ERC721: none
ERC777: none
FEE-ON-TRANSFER: none
REBASING TOKENS: none
ADMIN: trusted
```

If the smart contract system is deployed in mainnet, the front-running can be a issue.

If the intention of the admin is to update the controller address or redeemable asset address and make the old controller address not usuable.

A malicious user can watch for the mempool and front-run the updateController and setReedemable to execute the transaction before admin's updateController, setRedeemable transaction is landed in mainnet.

Such frontrunning mechanism applies to whitelistAsset and unregisterDepository.

If the admin wants to disable a asset and not let user mint or redeem given a asset or wants to remove a problematic or vulnerable depository by calling unregisterDepository,

 a user can watch for the mempool to execute mint or redeem transaction before the asset is disabled or before the depository is unregistered.

## Impact

Admin's cruical state can be frontrun-ed by malicious user that executes bad intention transaction (mint or redeem) before the admin's state update transaction landed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the project pause the redeem and mint transaction first before perform crucial state update. 

I implore the sponsors to explore alternatives to this update mechanism as they can be easily bypassed, especially so by sophisticated users who presumably are the ones who wants to get the mint or redeem transaction landed with problematic controller / disabled asset / oudated / vulnerable depository.
