# Use safetransfer instead of transfer for ERC20 contracts

## Summary

The transfer() and transferFrom() functions return a boolean value and needs to be checked for success. Some tokens do not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead.

A similar problem can be seen in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-dodo-judging/issues/47

If the protocol uses a token as collateral that does not return bool (USDT,BNB,OMG), or returns false instead (ZRX), then the function will not work as intended.

## Vulnerability Detail

        IERC20(redeemParams.assetToken).transfer(redeemParams.intermediary, amountOut);

## Impact

Callers might not properly handle tokens that are not ERC20 compliant.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use OpenZeppelin's Safetransfer library to handle transfer functions appropriately or check the transfer() for success.
