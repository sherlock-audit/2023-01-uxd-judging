# OwnableUpgradeable uses single-step ownership transfer

## Summary

`OwnableUpgradeable` uses single-step ownership transfer which means, if Owner transfer is done to Wrong address, it can't be undone.

## Vulnerability Detail

Single-step ownership transfer means that if a wrong address was passed when transferring ownership or admin rights it can mean that role is lost forever.

The ownership pattern implementation for the protocol is in `OwnableUpgradeable.sol` where a single-step transfer is implemented. This can be a problem for all methods marked in `onlyOwner` throughout the protocol, some of which are core protocol functionality.

## Impact

Failure in accessing all the `onlyOwner` modifier Functions.

## Code Snippet

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is a best practice to use two-step ownership transfer pattern, meaning ownership transfer gets to a "pending" state and the new owner should claim his new rights, otherwise the old owner still has control of the contract. Consider using OpenZeppelin's `Ownable2Step` contract
