# Use safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom consistently instead of transfer/transferFrom

## Vulnerability Detail
It is good to add a `require()` statement that checks the return value of token transfers or to use something like OpenZeppelinâ€™s `safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom` unless one is sure the given token reverts in case of a failure. Failure to do so will cause silent failures of transfers and affect token accounting in contract.

## Impact
Token transfers might fail silently without reverting.

## Code Snippet

Collateral token transfers in function `mint()` did not check for return value
```solidity
address depository = router.findDepositoryForDeposit(assetToken, assetAmount);
collateral.transferFrom(
    account,
    depository,
    assetAmount
);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using `safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom` or `require()` to check for return value.
