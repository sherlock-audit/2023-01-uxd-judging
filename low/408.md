# The transferred funds could be lost if zero address is passed in as function argument

## Summary

The `function transferETH(address payable to, uint256 amount)` in the **UXDTimelockController.sol** is not conducting the check for the zero address for the passed in address parameter `to` address.

## Vulnerability Detail

Since this function is only callable by the `onlySelf` which means by the contract itself (governance), and if by mistake a zero address is passed in as the `to` address the transfered ETH will be lost forever.

## Impact

`value: amount` the amount which is passed in through the low level `call` function will be lost. 

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/governance/UXDTimelockController.sol?plain=1#L40-L44

    function transferETH(address payable to, uint256 amount) external onlySelf nonReentrant {
        // solhint-disable-next-line avoid-low-level-calls
        (bool success,) = to.call{value: amount}(""); //@audit - needs to perform the require(to != address(0), "Zero Adddress")
        require(success, "Failed to send ETH");
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review, VSCode

## Recommendation

conduct the check for the zero address for the `to` address passed in.
`require(to != address(0), "Zero Adddress")`

So the updated code snippet will be as follows:


    function transferETH(address payable to, uint256 amount) external onlySelf nonReentrant {
        require(to != address(0), "Zero Adddress");
        // solhint-disable-next-line avoid-low-level-calls
        (bool success,) = to.call{value: amount}(""); //@audit - needs to perform the require(to != address(0), "Zero Adddress")
        require(success, "Failed to send ETH");
    }
