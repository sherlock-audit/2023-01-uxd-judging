# Depositories are not Pausable

## Summary
If Perp/Rage Trade are compromised, the Owner has no way of stopping further loss of user funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

Users directly interact with depositories via UXDController. If Perp or Rage Trade contracts are compromised, then users will lose funds when interacting with it and the project cannot stop it.

If the contracts were Pausable, then the owner could stop the external contractâ€™s rugpull from happening.

## Impact
Possible loss of user funds on compromised Perp/Rage Trade.

## Code Snippet
```solidity

    UUPSUpgradeable,

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add Pausable logic to the 2 depositories. Make them separate, so if 1 is compromised, other can continue working.
