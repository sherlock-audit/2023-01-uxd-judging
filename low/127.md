# Unbounded Loop When Attempting to Remove and Add Assets in `UXDController`

## Summary
The `UXDController` contract is the front-facing contract which allows users to mint UXD tokens. There's a functionality which allows admins  to add and remove collateral assets from the protocol however, this implementation may cause the contract to run out of gas and fail. 

## Vulnerability Detail
There exists an unbounded loop in the `UXDController` contract because the assetList does not have a fixed number of iterations when attempting to discover already added assets. 

## Impact
This was rated a Medium in severity because the `assetList` needs to grow to a point where enough gas is consumed to deny the owner from adding a new asset or removing an old one. In short - the owner may never be able to remove or add collateral assets for the contract.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It's recommend that the protocol continues to maintain the original `assetList` array and implement a mapping for `O(1)` lookups based on the address keys.
