# Contracts donâ€™t use 2-step ownership transfer process

## Summary

Owner may accidentally transfer ownership to inoperable address due to missing 2-step ownership transfer process.

## Vulnerability Detail

Project uses OZ-s `OwnableUpgradeable`, which does not include 2-step ownership transfer safeguard.

For example in an important contract `UXDController`, you inherit from `OwnableUpgradeable`

```solidity
contract UXDController is
    UUPSUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable,
    OwnableUpgradeable,
    UXDControllerStorage
{
```

`OwnableUgpradeable.sol`

```solidity
function renounceOwnership() public virtual onlyOwner {
    _transferOwnership(address(0));
}

function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public virtual onlyOwner {
    require(newOwner != address(0), "Ownable: new owner is the zero address");
    _transferOwnership(newOwner);
}
```

This is especially important safeguard, because you transfer the ownership of the contracts while the project is running(from project ownership to governance via `2_transfer_ownership.ts`) 

## Impact

Possible bricking of contracts via transfer to wrong owner. 

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public virtual onlyOwner {
    require(newOwner != address(0), "Ownable: new owner is the zero address");
    _transferOwnership(newOwner);
}
```

Manual review

## Recommendation

Use a 2-step ownership transfer process. You could inherit from `OwnableUgpradeable.sol`, and overwrite `transferOwnership` method and add `acceptOwnership` method.
