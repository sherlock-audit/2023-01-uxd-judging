# Function should be removed from contract

## Summary

Function should be removed from contract as indicated in the TODO, but is not removed.

## Vulnerability Detail

TODO mentions to remove the function.

    /// @dev Withdraw profits. Ensure redeemable is still fully backed by asset balance after this is run.
    /// TODO: Remove this function. Code profit access and use in contracts
    function withdrawProfits(address receiver) external onlyOwner nonReentrant {
        int256 pnl = getUnrealizedPnl();
        if (pnl <= 0) {
            revert NoProfits(pnl);
        }
        uint256 profits = uint256(pnl);
        vault.withdraw(profits, receiver, address(this));
        realizedPnl += profits;
    }

## Impact

Might cause unintended protocol interference.
