# Admin can deposit user's tokens as insurance in ```PerpDepository.sol```

## Summary

The admin of ```PerpDepository.sol``` can use the quote tokens of any user that has given approval to the contract as an insurance deposit to the Perp vault.

## Vulnerability Detail

The ```depositInsurance``` function in ```PerpDepository.sol``` allows the admin to deposit insurance tokens into the Perp vault. The ```from``` address may be any address that has given approval to send insurance tokens to the PerpDepository. Since the depository contains functions that require the caller to pre-approve the depository, the admin could call ```depositInsurance``` with any address that has given approval to the depository.

## Impact

In the case that the admin has been compromised, users could lose all quote tokens approved to the depository.

## Recommendation

Consider using ```msg.sender``` instead of ```from``` in the ```depositInsurance``` function.
