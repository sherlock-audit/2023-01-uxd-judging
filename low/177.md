# `whitelistAsset` doesn't check if given address implement IERC20 functions

## Summary
In the `UXDController.sol` contract, `whitelistAsset` function there is no check that the `address asset` is an ERC20 token, which could lead to unexpected behaviour.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `whitelistAsset` function checks wether the provided assets is a contract, but that's not enough, it should also check that it implements the IERC20 interface.

## Impact
An admin may mistakenly add an asset which is not a valid ERC20 token (doesn't implement the IERC20 functions), which could lead to unexpected behaviour and failed attempts to redeem and mint.

## Code Snippet
Insufficient check (only isContract):

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add to the `whitelistAsset` function a check that the asset is a valid ERC20 token.
