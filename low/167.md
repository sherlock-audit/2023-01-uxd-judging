# Many ERC20 transfers' results are not checked.

## Summary
In some contracts of this repo, ERC20 **transfers** (and **transferFrom**) results are not checked. 

Some ERC20 implementations can have a failed transfer without reverting. 

For example the ZRX token:

`function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint _value) returns (bool) {
        if (balances[_from] >= _value && allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value && balances[_to] + _value >= balances[_to]) {
            balances[_to] += _value;
            balances[_from] -= _value;
            allowed[_from][msg.sender] -= _value;
            Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
            return true;
        } else { return false; }
}`

This can lead to dangerous and unexpected behavior.

## Vulnerability Detail

- In **UXDController.sol**, **mint** function we have the following code:
`collateral.transferFrom(
            account,
            depository,
            assetAmount
        );
        InternalMintParams memory mintParams = InternalMintParams({
            assetToken: assetToken,
            assetAmount: assetAmount,
            minAmountOut: minAmountOut,
            receiver: receiver,
            depository: depository
        });
        return _mint(mintParams);`

If **transferFrom** fails without reverting (and if the contract has some balance which could happen), minting could be possible without having supplied collateral.

-  In **UXDController.sol**, **_redeem** function we have the following code:
`   redeemable.burn(msg.sender, redeemParams.amountToRedeem);
        // xcz: high risk here, safetransfer should be used, if transfer fails, you have burn and are left with nothing!
        IERC20(redeemParams.assetToken).transfer(redeemParams.intermediary, amountOut);
 `
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDController.sol#L336-L337

Here, if the transfer fails without reverting, the user will have burned his redeemable tokens without getting asset back.

There are many other **transfer** and **transferFrom** in **PerpDepository** that could lead to dangerous behavior if transfer fails without reverting.


## Impact
If a token that does not revert is whitelisted as collateral, it could lead to incoherent states in contracts, and users able to mint without transfering tokens or not being able to redeem collateral.

If **quoteToken** or **redeemableToken** are ERC20 that do not revert when transfer/transferFrom fail, we may have incorrect behaviors too.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check return code from all **transfer** and **transferFrom** with this kind of code for example:
`require(token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), sendAmount), "Token transfer failed!"); `

or use **SafeERC20** from openzeppelin (https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc20#SafeERC20)
