# return value of transferFrom not checked can cause loss of funds for user

## Summary
Some ERC20 tokens return false on a failed transfer. As return value of transferFrom is not checked, transferFrom can fail but the transaction will not revert. 

## Vulnerability Detail

`transferFrom` in rebalance is used to either transfer the shortfall of quoteToken from user to perpDepository or transfer excess quoteToken to user. Notice that user transfer quoteToken to perpDepository is not an issue because the vault will have to deposit the quoteToken and do a safeTransferFrom so it will revert when the quoteToken amount is insufficient. However, when excess shortFall is transferred to user, a failed transfer will cause user to lose the funds they should receive.
```solidity
        if (shortFall > 0) {
            IERC20(quoteToken).transferFrom(
                account,
                address(this),
                uint256(shortFall)
            );
        } else if (shortFall < 0) {
            // we got excess tokens in the spot swap. Send them to the account paying for rebalance
            IERC20(quoteToken).transfer(
                account,
                _abs(shortFall)
            );
        }
        vault.deposit(quoteToken, quoteAmount);
```


## Impact
User who rebalance with a ERC20 quote token that do not revert on failure may lose funds.
