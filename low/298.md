# Return value of ERC-20 functions are not validated

## Summary

The return value of ERC-20 functions are not validated.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol does not validate the return value of `approve`, `transfer` and `transferFrom`. Some ERC-20 tokens return no value on failure (and instead revert or throw) while others simply return `false` and do not revert. 

Because of that, it should not be assumed that a non-reverting execution equals a successful call. Return values should be checked in order to guarantee that approvals and transfers succeeded.

## Impact

Tokens might not have been transferred even though the `transfer` or `transferFrom` calls did not revert. Approvals might not have been granted even though `approve` did not revert.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDController.sol#L195-L199

```solidity
        collateral.transferFrom(
            account,
            depository,
            assetAmount
        );
```

Other occurrences are in `PerpDepository.sol` and throughout the codebase

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use OpenZeppelin's [SafeERC20](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc20#SafeERC20) wrapper that properly handles both reverting and non-reverting tokens.

In addition, run [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) through the codebase. All occurrences of this error will be identified.
