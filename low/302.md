# UXDTimelockController timelock can be bypassed by contract deployer

## Summary

The timelock feature of the `UXDTimelockController` contract can be bypassed by the contract deployer. 

## Vulnerability Detail

This happens because OpenZeppelin's `TimelockController` [version 4.6.0](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v4.6/contracts/governance/TimelockController.sol#L69-L73) contract, used by the project, states that:

> At construction, both the deployer and the timelock itself are administrators. This helps further configuration of the timelock by the deployer. After configuration is done, it is recommended that the deployer renounces its admin position and relies on timelocked operations to perform future maintenance.

The recommendation of the deployer renouncing the admin is not followed, and thus can bypass any proposal from the governance.

Although Sherlock qualifies centralization risks as out of scope, this issue is arguably a mistake from the protocol team. In general, the `TIMELOCK_ADMIN_ROLE` role is reserved for the governance admin multisig wallet, that is managed by a high number of signers in order to maximize security (e.g. 4 out of 7 multisig), while the contract deployer is a simple EOA used by the developer that is implementing the code.

## Impact

The contract deployer can bypass any timelock on the project's governance

```solidity
    constructor(
        uint256 minDelay,
        address[] memory proposers,
        address[] memory executors
    ) TimelockController(minDelay, proposers, executors) {}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Renounce the ownership of the deployer account on the `UXDTimelockController` controller.
