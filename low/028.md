# Setting new mint cap should be above the localMintAmount

## Summary
The `UXDToken` contract tracks the maximum amount of minted `UXD` tokens via `localMintCap` and the net amount minted via `localMintAmount`. 

The contract allows for setting the global supply cap for UXD token via the `setLocalMintCap ()` function as shown here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDToken.sol#L95-L100.

However, this function only check if the `newMintCap` is greater than 0 as shown here: `require(newMintCap > 0, "Zero Amount");`. It does not ascertain that the new proposed cap is greater than the net minted amount as tracked by `localMintAmount`. Therefore, if the new cap set is less than the `localMintAmount` this would limit minting operations. 

Moreover, the contract comments suggest that this value will only be set by the contract governance. This implies that this would be subject to time delays which would mean that it would take longer to rectify this mistake if it happens. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The `setLocalMintCap ()` function does not ascertain that the new suggested mint cap is greater than the `localMintAmount` as shown here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDToken.sol#L95-L100.
## Impact
1. Minting would work
2. Correcting this mistake would take longer as it is subject to a governance proposal as suggested by the project.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implementing the `setLocalMintCap ()` function as follows: 
``` solidity
function setLocalMintCap(uint256 newMintCap) external onlyOwner {
        require(newMintCap > 0, "Zero Amount");
        require(newMintCap > localMintAmount, );
        localMintCap = newMintCap;

        emit LocalMintCapChanged(msg.sender, localMintCap);
    }
```
