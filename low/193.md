# UXDController will not work well if using non-reverting on failure ERC20 tokens as collateral

## Summary
Contract `UXDController` does not check for the result of the external call when adding or removing collateral, so in case the collateral used does not revert on failure (just returning false), the execution would continue and could allow a user to mint free UXD tokens (in the case of minting) or not getting the correct amount of collateral (in the case of redeeming).

## Vulnerability Detail
Functions `mint` and `_redeem` transfer collateral from the user to the depository and viceversa. If the collateral token used does not revert on failure, a user with zero balance of collateral could mint an arbitrary amount of UXD free, because:
```solidity
collateral.transferFrom(
	account,
	depository,
	assetAmount
);
```
this call would return false and the execution would continue, effectively minting the UXD to the caller.

In the case of `redeem` it would mean that this line:
```solidity
IERC20(redeemParams.assetToken).transfer(redeemParams.intermediary, amountOut);
```
could also return false, meaning the user would have burnt his UXD in return for nothing.
## Impact
Medium impact, as the team has no plans to whitelist any non-reverting on failure ERC20 token for now. But overseeing this issue could lead to high losses for the protocol in case they want to add any of these tokens as a supported collateral.

## Tool used
Manual review



## Recommendation
Use openzeppelin `SafeERC20.sol` library's functions `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom`.
