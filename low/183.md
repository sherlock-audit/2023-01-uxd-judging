# Return values of ERC20 `transfer` and `transferFrom` are not checked - tokens can be drained

## Summary
Some ERC20 tokens donâ€™t revert but just return false when a transfer fails.
A good example of such a token is ZRX: [Etherscan code](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#code#L64)

In case such tokens will be supported by the protocol in the future (which might happen),
This can be abused to trick the `mint()` function to mint UXD tokens without providing any tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `mint()` function in the `UXDController.sol` used the `transferFrom` function to transfer the provided tokens from the msg.sender to the relevant depository.
The return value is not checked and in case it's a token which doesn't implement properly the ERC20 standard, it will lead to minted UXD without providing and tokens to the depository.

## Impact
`mint()` function can be tricked to mint UXD tokens without providing any tokens, which could hyper-inflate the UXD token supply and lead to depegging and collapse of the protocol.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use [SafeERC20 library implementation](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol) from Openzeppelin and call safeTransfer or safeTransferFrom when transferring ERC20 tokens.
