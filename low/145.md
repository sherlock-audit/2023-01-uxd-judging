# Wasteful Gas Consumption

## Summary
Certain checks to determine if the transaction should revert are placed in locations that could cause unnecessary gas consumption for users. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Checks such as input verification should be done as soon as possible. Checking later will only result in more expensive failed transactions for consumers.

## Impact
More expensive transactions

## Code Snippet

This check occurs in the `_mint()` call. It should be moved up higher into the `mint` function. The provided asset is handed in as a parameter and this call should be made immediately. Further more, it is likely not necessary for users calling the `mintWithEth()` to also go through this same check. (Assumption: ETH/WETH will always be a whitelisted token).

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
This same call should be made at line #189
