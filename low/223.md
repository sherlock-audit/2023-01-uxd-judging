# Lack of sanity check

## Summary
When registering depository, if address depository == address(0) all funds can be lost due to a lack of sanity check.
## Vulnerability Detail
If owner registers a depository with zero address. There is no check in the code for that.

test:
```solidity
it("can register depositories", async () => {
    const zeroAddress = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000";

    await (await router.registerDepository(zeroAddress, asset1)).wait();

    const depositoryAddress = await router.findDepositoryForDeposit(
      asset1,
      amount
    );
    expect(depositoryAddress).to.equal(zeroAddress);
  });

```

## Impact
Asset tokens can be lost.
