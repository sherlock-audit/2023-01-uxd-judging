# PerpDepository.sol : transfer's return value is not validated

## Summary

In following places `transfer` function call is used to transfer the asset in PerpDepository.sol .

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L301
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L639

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L639

The issue here is, for some tokens if added as asset, the transfer status will be decided based on the return statement from the transfer call.

I believe that the UXD would accepts wide range of assets as time goes on due to increasing the number of valid tokens.
Though, the current implementation is interacting only with WETH and USDC, I would like to flag this as issue by considering the future scope of the project.

For some reference, https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#:~:text=Missing%20Return%20Values This has basic examples about how this would come possible.

From IERC20.sol,

    /**
     * @dev Moves `amount` tokens from the caller's account to `to`.
     *
     * Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.
     *
     * Emits a {Transfer} event.
     */
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);

## Vulnerability Detail

Refer the summary section.

## Impact

For some asset tokens, even if the transfer failed, it will be treated as succeeded.

## Code Snippet

Refer the summary section.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I saw the protocol is handling it correctly in [UXDTimelockController.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/governance/UXDTimelockController.sol#L62) .

but not in the PerpDepository.sol.
