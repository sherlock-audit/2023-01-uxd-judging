# Unsafe Minting Practice

## Summary
Unnecessary gas consumption due to redundant check.

## Vulnerability Detail
The immutable controller is insured at construction to not be the zero address. It is not necessary to check every function call if controller is zero.

## Impact
Extra check (gas consumption) is done on every call.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove redundant check

```solidity
modifier onlyController() {
        if (msg.sender != controller) {
            revert NotController(msg.sender);
        }
        _;
    }
```
