# `UXDTimelockController.approveERC20` can be frontrun and attacker can spend more allowance than expected

## Summary

The `UXDTimelockController.approveERC20` function can be frontrun and the attacker can spend more allowance than expected. 

## Vulnerability Detail

This happens because the `UXDTimelockController.approveERC20` function uses `IERC20(token).approve`, which is vulnerable to an attack vector with `approve` / `transferFrom`: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/edit 


Here is a possible attack scenario:
1. Alice allows Bob to transfer N of Alice's tokens (N>0)  by calling the approve method on a Token smart contract, passing the Bob's address and N as the method arguments
2. After some time, Alice decides to change from N to M (M>0) the number of Alice's tokens Bob is allowed to transfer, so she calls the approve method again, this time passing the Bob's address and M as the method arguments
3. Bob notices the Alice's second transaction before it was mined and quickly sends another transaction that calls the transferFrom method to transfer N Alice's tokens somewhere
4. If the Bob's transaction will be executed before the Alice's transaction, then Bob will successfully transfer N Alice's tokens and will gain an ability to transfer another M tokens
5. Before Alice noticed that something went wrong, Bob calls the transferFrom method again, this time to transfer M Alice's tokens.

So, an Alice's attempt to change the Bob's allowance from N to M (N>0 and M>0) made it possible for Bob to transfer N+M of Alice's tokens, while Alice never wanted to allow so many of her tokens to be transferred by Bob.


## Impact

An attacker can spend more tokens than the allowance set by the `UXDTimelockController`.

```solidity
    function approveERC20(address token, address spender, uint256 amount) external onlySelf {
        if (!(IERC20(token).approve(spender, amount))) {
            revert TimelockERC20ApprovalFailed(token, spender, amount);
        }
    }
