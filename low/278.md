# Lack of two-step procedure for critical operation

## Summary
setController function is extremely important to the security of this contract. However there is lack of zero address check and lack of 2 step address changing.

## Vulnerability Detail
Lack of 0-address check for setController function.
Also I recommend to make changing address process into 2-step process to avoid accidently setting controller to wrong address.

## Impact
```solidity
PerpDepository.sol:

function setController(address _controller) external onlyOwner { 
        if (!_controller.isContract()) {
            revert AddressNotContract(_controller);
        }
        controller = _controller;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add zero address check for setController function.
Change setController() function address changing process to 2-step process.
