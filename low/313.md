# A `storage` pointer is used instead of a `memory` pointer despite there is no state change

## Summary
A `storage` pointer is used instead of a `memory` pointer despite there is no state change.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the functions below, a `storage` pointer is used instead of a `memory` pointer despite there is no state change.

- In the `_firstDepositoryForAsset()` function, a `storage` pointer is used at the line of [UXDRouter.sol#L102](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDRouter.sol#L102):
```solidity
address[] storage depositories = _depositoriesForAsset[assetToken];
```

- In the `_checkDepositoriesForAsset()` function, a `storage` pointer is used at the line of [UXDRouter.sol#L114](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDRouter.sol#L114):
```solidity
address[] storage byAsset = _depositoriesForAsset[assetToken];
```

## Impact
This lead to misunderstanding when any additional implementations that the functions above are included would be done in the future.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using a `memory` pointer instead of a `storage` pointer in the functions above.
