# UXDControllerStorage.sol - array based asset list handling would cause DOS when more number of asset tokens accepted by the protocol.

## Summary

The list of accepted collateral are stored in an array `address[] public assetList;`. From this array, any token want to be added then it is done in UXDController. Functions _addAsset and _removeAsset are used to either add or remove the asset by the owner as whitelisted asset. For add/remove, array is traversed and updated.

Given the current tokenomics model and increasing the number of tokens, I believe UXD would support more number of asset tokens.

When this happens, the array size by adding asset. In this scenario, the function call `whitelistAsset` would affect by DOS due to large size of array and the number of traversal the asset array would subject to.

## Vulnerability Detail

Refer the summary section.

## Impact

Potential DOS , Owner not able to call the `whitelistAsset` function anymore.

Owner can not delist any asset from usage incase if they wanted.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

use map based asset tokens handling instead of array based.
