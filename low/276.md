# Single-step ownership transfer can be dangerous

## Summary
The transferOwnership function is a delicate process. It could lead to loss of authorization to critical functions incase of typos or bad copy/paste. A two step process should be used as a guard against setting the wrong admin.

## Vulnerability Detail
Single-step ownership transfer means that if a wrong address was passed when transferring ownership or admin rights it can mean that role is lost forever. 

## Impact
The owner is responsible for setting multiple critical operation..Loss of the ownership role would therefore lead to breaking of how the protocol works including loss of funds.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The new owner should be added without first overwriting the previous one. Once this is done, the new owner can then remove the old one. A check for the 0 address should also be added.
