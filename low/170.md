# Unhandled return of transfer & transferFrom ERC20 calls

## Summary
There are a few ERC20 transfers and transferFrom calls whose returned are not handled. ERC20 implementations are not always consistent. Some implementations of transfer and transferFrom could return ‘false’ on failure instead of reverting. 
## Vulnerability Detail
`collateral.transferFrom(
            account,
            depository,
            assetAmount
        );`
This ERC20 call to transfer collateral from the user to the `depository` contract might fail for some ERC20 implementations and the transaction will not revert as well. In that case, no collateral will be deposited from the user but UXD will be minted for those users.        

## Impact
Users might be able to mint UXD tokens with no collateral deposit.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is safer to wrap such calls into require() statements to these failures or use safeERC20 wrapper.
