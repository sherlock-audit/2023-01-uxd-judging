# Some tokens don't revert but instead return false .

## Summary
Some ERC20 tokens don't throw error , but just returns false. This case needs to be handled properly . 
But `UXDController` does not handle this case , thereby causing incorrect accounting and loss  to users . 


## Vulnerability Detail
The `UXDController` contract's `_redeem` function  sends asset to the `receiver` address by calling `transfer ` selector of the relevant asset contract . 


## Impact
Even if the `transfer` fails , the call will still hold true in the end , thereby causing direct fund loss for the user .

## Recommendation
Use  Openzeppelin 's [safeTransfer](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L22) function to transfer the asset tokens back to the`receiver` safely. .
