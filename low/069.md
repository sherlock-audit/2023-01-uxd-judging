# Transfer of some tokens will not be possible

## Summary
Some ERC20 tokens does not return a bool value on transfer (like USDT) which means such tokens will fail while using `transferERC20` function as it enforce checking the return value of transfer

## Vulnerability Detail
1. A proposal passed which asks to transfer all USDT present to address X using the [transferERC20](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/governance/UXDTimelockController.sol#L62)

```solidity
function transferERC20(address token, address to, uint256 amount) external onlySelf nonReentrant  {
        if (!(IERC20(token).transfer(to, amount))) {
            revert TimelockERC20TransferFailed(token, to, amount);
        }
    }
```

2. Since USDT has no return boolean value on `IERC20(token).transfer(to, amount)` so the function fails 
3. This means that there will be no way to transfer the USDT

## Impact
Impacted tokens will not be transferrable and would be stuck in contract

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Since this function is not having any accounting it is safe to remove check for output status in transfer 

```solidity
function transferERC20(address token, address to, uint256 amount) external onlySelf nonReentrant  {
        IERC20(token).transfer(to, amount);
    }
```
