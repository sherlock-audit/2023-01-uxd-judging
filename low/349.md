## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

## Code Snippet
- [PerpDepository.sol#L179](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L179)
```jsx
function depositInsurance(uint256 amount, address from)
        external
        nonReentrant
        onlyOwner
    {
```
```jsx
function withdrawInsurance(uint256 amount, address to)
        external
        nonReentrant
        onlyOwner
    {
```
```jsx
function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public override(IDepository, OwnableUpgradeable) onlyOwner {
        super.transferOwnership(newOwner);
    }

function setController(address _controller) external onlyOwner {
        if (!_controller.isContract()) {
            revert AddressNotContract(_controller);
        }
        controller = _controller;
    }

function setSpotSwapper(address _swapper) external onlyOwner {
        if (!_swapper.isContract()) {
            revert AddressNotContract(_swapper);
        }
        spotSwapper = ISwapper(_swapper);
    }

   
    function setRedeemableSoftCap(uint256 softCap) external onlyOwner {
        if (softCap == 0) {
            revert ZeroAmount();
        }
        redeemableSoftCap = softCap;

        emit RedeemableSoftCapUpdated(msg.sender, softCap);
    }
