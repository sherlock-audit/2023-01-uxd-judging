# Use of insecure transfer in withdrawInsurance

## Summary
It was observed that `withdrawInsurance` function is using unsafe `transfer` function instead of `safeTransfer`. This means contract will have no way to know if transfer was success or not. 

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Assume `insuranceToken()` is a token which returns bool status on using `transfer` function indicating the transfer status
2. Let's say owner calls the `withdrawInsurance` insurance function 
3. This first deduct the `insuranceDeposited` with amount being withdrawn

```solidity
insuranceDeposited -= amount;
```

4. Now this is withdrawn from Vault and transferred to User

```solidity
IERC20(insuranceToken()).transfer(to, amount);
```

5. Lets say transfer was not success and `false` is returned
6. Since transfer status is not checked so `false` is ignored and function completes
7. Now no amount is transferred (as status was false) but `insuranceDeposited` got reduced. This means this amount cannot be claimed now and is permanently stuck in contract

## Impact
In case if transfer was not success then funds will not be recoverable

## Tool used

## Recommendation
Use safeTransfer instead of transfer function as shown below:

```solidity
IERC20(insuranceToken()).safeTransfer(to, amount);
```
