# Insurance funds can be locked in PrepDepository

## Summary

In some cases, the `transfer()` function of an ERC20 token might fail without reverting therefore it's important to check the returned bool value.

Here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L301
the transfer might fail leading the protocol in a bad state where the funds have been withdrawn from the vault but not properly transfered afterwards and consequently the funds can get locked in the contract.
