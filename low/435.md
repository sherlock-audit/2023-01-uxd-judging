# User funds may get stuck inside protocol

## Summary
Should there is a timelock functionality for giving users chance to make decision.

## Vulnerability Detail
Owner can ```Updates the list of tokens that can be used as collateral.``` by calling ```_addAsset(address asset)``` and ```_removeAsset(address asset)``` whenever possible

So let consider a senario where a user Deposit some collateral in form of ```tokenA```
Then owner for some reason remove that ```tokenA``` as collateral by calling ```_removeAsset(address tokenA)```
Now that fund get locked inside contract,

Or Owner can revert user calls by frontrunning.

```solidity
    function _removeAsset(address asset) private { // @audit-issue
        uint256 foundIndex = type(uint256).max;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < assetList.length; i++) {
            if (asset == assetList[i]) {
                foundIndex = i;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (foundIndex != type(uint256).max) {
            if (foundIndex != assetList.length - 1) {
                assetList[foundIndex] = assetList[assetList.length-1];
            }
            assetList.pop();
        }
    }
```

## Impact
User fund get stuck, bad impression on user experience

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There should be a timelock functionality on ```_addAsset(address asset)``` and ```_removeAsset(address asset)``` so that users will be aware of what will the next move on Protocol for status of collateral Lists
