# Deposit get stuck

## Summary
If at current moment pnl has reduced to negative then deposit of quote token is allowed. Now due to varying market condition, pnl rises to a positive value, still the quote amount cannot be withdrawn

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Lets say current position has a negative Pnl
2. Deposit of quoteToken is made using the `deposit` function

```solidity
function deposit(
        address asset,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyController returns (uint256) {
        if (asset == assetToken) {
           ...
        } else if (asset == quoteToken) {
            return _processQuoteMint(amount);
        } else {
            ...
        }
    }
```

3. After sometime of this deposit, due to price fluctuations, the Pnl turn positive
4. This means the extra quoteToken deposit is no more required
5. But the excess quoteToken cannot be withdrawn since quoteToken redeem is disabled

```solidity
function redeem(
        address asset,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyController returns (uint256) {
        if (asset == assetToken) {
            ...
        } else if (asset == quoteToken) {
            revert QuoteRedeemDisabled(msg.sender);
            // return _processQuoteRedeem(amount);
        } else {
            ...
        }
    }
```

6. This becomes a problem if amount of quoteToken deposited was too large and market conditions make it very difficult to reach that negative Pnl amount again

## Impact
Deposit of quoteToken will remain stuck even when Pnl has turned positive and the surplus is not even required

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
If Pnl is positive then redeeming of quoteToken should be allowed (max upto quoteMinted)
