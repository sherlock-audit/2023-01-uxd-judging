# `quoteAmount` with incorrect number of decimals passed to `vault.deposit()` in `PerpDepository._rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap()`

## Summary
In `PerpDepository._rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap()`, `vault.deposit()` is given `quoteAmount`, which is in 18 decimals, but accepts amounts in the `quoteToken` number of decimals. This will cause `rebalance()` to always revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
`vault.deposit()` acceppts `quoteToken` decimals, but `quoteAmount` is in 18 decimals. For 1 USDC, this means that `vault.deposit()` is given 1e18 (corresponding to 1000 trillion USD) and will always fail.

## Impact
If rebalancing doesn't work, then there is a high risk that UXD will loose its peg.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of `quoteAmount`, use `quoteAmountOut`, which is in the tokens native decimals:

```solidity
vault.deposit(quoteToken, quoteAmountOut);
```
