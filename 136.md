# using the low-level function ".call" there is no checks for contract existence

## Summary
using the low-level function ".call" there is no checks for contract existence.

## Vulnerability Detail
At https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/governance/UXDTimelockController.sol#L42

    function transferETH(address payable to, uint256 amount) external onlySelf nonReentrant {
        // solhint-disable-next-line avoid-low-level-calls
        (bool success,) = to.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Failed to send ETH");
    }

## Impact
In the specific case of the `transferETH` function, the `call` function is being used to send a specified amount of Ether to the address specified by the to parameter. The `call` function is being used with a single tuple argument containing a single element, value, which specifies the amount of Ether to send. The function does not include any data to be passed to the contract being called, as indicated by the empty string argument.

The call function returns a tuple containing a single element, success, which indicates whether the call was successful. The `require` statement at the end of the function checks the value of success and reverts the transaction if the call was not successful.

It is worth noting that the `call` function can fail for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to:

    The contract being called does not exist
    The contract being called does not contain the function being called
    The function being called requires more gas than is available
    The function being called throws an exception

As such, using the `call` function to send Ether to an address does not guarantee that the Ether will be received by a contract, or that the contract will exist. It is always a good idea to carefully review the code and documentation for any functions that you are planning to `call`, and to ensure that you understand their behavior and any potential risks.

## Code Snippet
`        (bool success,) = to.call{value: amount}("");`

## Recommendation
Check for contract existence on low-level calls, so that failures are not missed.
