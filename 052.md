# DOS by frontrunning UXDController.sol initialize() function

## Summary

UXDController.sol implement an `initialize()` function , which has no access control implemented. Anyone can call the function.
Due to this an attacker may be able to frontrun the function and cause unintended issues.

## Vulnerability Details
A malicious attacker could monitor the blockchain for bytecode that matches the UXDController.sol contract and frontrun the `initialize()` transaction to gain ownership of the contract.

## Impact
An attacker could bypass the `onlyOwner` restriction , by becoming the owner of the contract. This would allow the attacker to change asset address or whitelist them, and also update the router, and many other things.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function initialize(address _weth) public initializer {
        __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
        __ReentrancyGuard_init();
        __Ownable_init();

        if (!_weth.isContract()) {
            revert CtrlAddressNotContract(_weth);
        }
        weth = _weth;
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement proper access control for the `initialize` function
