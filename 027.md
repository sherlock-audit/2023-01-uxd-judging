# Lack of enough support for fee on transfer tokens (USDC)

## Summary
Although the project states it does not use any fee on transfer tokens, it clearly state it uses USDC. USDC is an upgradable token which means that although at the moment it is no a deflationary token, there is no guarantee that this will always be same. 

Therefore, in any event USDC becomes a deflationary token, then the `UXDController` contract would lead to losses
## Vulnerability Detail
The `mint ()` function performs collateral transfer as shown here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDController.sol#L195-L199.
The `redeem ()` function also performs transfer of tokens as follows: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDController.sol#L337. 

In the event that USDC is upgraded to be a fee on transfer token, then the contract would mint more UXD tokens for less collateral provided
## Impact
In the event that USDC is upgraded to be a fee on transfer token, then the contract would mint more UXD tokens for less collateral provided

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider checking the balance before and after when performing `mint` operations
