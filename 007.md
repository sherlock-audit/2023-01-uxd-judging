# Vulnerable Openzepplin version is used, which affects GovernorVotesQuorumFraction used in the Governance contract

## Summary

Vulnerable Openzepplin version is used, which affects GovernorVotesQuorumFraction used in the Governance contract

## Vulnerability Detail

If we look into the package.json, the openzeppelin version 4.6.0 is used.

```solidity
"dependencies": {
"@openzeppelin/contracts": "^4.6.0",
"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable": "^4.6.0",
```

If we look into the governance contract:

the governance contract uses GovernorVotesQuorumFraction

```solidity
contract UXDGovernor is
    ReentrancyGuard,
    Governor,
    GovernorVotes,
    GovernorVotesQuorumFraction,
    GovernorTimelockControl,
    GovernorCountingSimple,
    GovernorSettings
{
```

Which is vulnerable in the used openzeppelin version.

> Incorrect Calculation
Affecting @openzeppelin/contracts package, versions >=4.3.0 <4.7.2

> @openzeppelin/contracts is a library for contract development.

> fected versions of this package are vulnerable to Incorrect Calculation via the GovernorVotesQuorumFraction module. This vulnerability is exploitable by passing a proposal to lower the quorum requirements, leading to past proposals possibly becoming executable if they had been defeated only due to lack of quorum, and the number of votes it received meets the new quorum requirement.
