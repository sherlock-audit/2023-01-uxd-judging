# PerpDepository has no way to withdraw profits depriving stakers of profits owed

## Summary

PerpDepository has no way to calculate or withdraw any profits made by the vault. By [design](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/rage-trade/RageDnDepository.sol#L99-L115) stakes are entitled to a portion of the profits generated by the delta-neutral strategy. The issue is that the vault never implements a way to withdraw profits to stakers, resulting in loss of revenue for them.

## Vulnerability Detail

See summary.

## Impact

Profits owed stakers will be trapped in the contract and they will lose that portion of their revenue
