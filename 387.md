# The protocol doesn't support tokens with fee and tokens without reverting on bad ``transfer()/approval()``

## Summary

The protocol will not work properly with the next token types:
1. Tokens with fee (when you send X tokens and receive only Y (Y < X) tokens, like USDT in Ethereum)
2. Tokens, which ``transfer()`` and ``approval()`` functions don't revert on errors and just return ``false``

## Vulnerability Detail

Such token types will break protocol logic and may lead to protocol funds loss and inconsistent behaviour

## Impact

1. Protocol funds loss
2. DoS of protocol

Below some of examples, but you do the same things everywhere
I consider this finding as ``HIGH`` because many of tokens are proxy tokens, so their behaviour may be changed any time
And it will lead to protocol problems
Or even you will want to support new tokens, which will have fees or different ``transfer()`` definition

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. User ``safeTransfer()`` and ``safeApproval()`` functions only
2. Do not rely on transferred value: if you transfer X tokens from user address to your address, do not consider as you received X tokens
Use the simple patern:

```solidity

uint256 balanceBefore = insuranceToken().balanceOf(this);

IERC20(insuranceToken()).transferFrom(from, address(this), amount);

uint256 balanceAfter = insuranceToken().balanceOf(this);

# in common case
#amount != balanceAfter - balanceBefore

```
