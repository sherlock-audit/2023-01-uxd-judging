# Unsafe ERC20 Operation(s),it may free mint UXD token.

## Summary
ERC20 operations can be unsafe due to different implementations and vulnerabilities in the standard.

## Vulnerability Detailï¼š
If the collateral token is implemented like BAT token which does not revert on failed transfer, it may free mint UXD token.

## Impact
free mint UXD token

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is therefore recommended to always either use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library or at least to wrap each operation in a require statement.
To circumvent ERC20's approve functions race-condition vulnerability use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library's safe{Increase|Decrease}Allowance functions.

```solidity
bool success = collateral.transferFrom(
            account,
            depository,
            assetAmount
        );
require(success, "ERC20 transfer failed");
        ...
```
