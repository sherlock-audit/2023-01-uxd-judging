# [NAZ-M8] `DnGmxSeniorVault.sol` Has Pause Features That `RageDnDepository.sol` Doesn't Account For

## Summary
If `DnGmxSeniorVault.sol` where to ever be paused  `RageDnDepository.sol` won't be able to account for it.

## Vulnerability Detail
`DnGmxSeniorVault.sol` is the vault used by `RageDnDepository.sol` for deposits and withdraws. This particular vault inherits `PausableUpgradeable` and if ever paused would cause deposits and withdraws to revert until unpaused. This would create risks and unexpected behavior for `RageDnDepository.sol` that should be handled appropriately.

## Impact
If there is an extreme case that requires the Rage Trade team to pause their vault to save funds that would be at risk. This would prompt a swift and stealthy action to do so, leaving `RageDnDepository.sol` to revert for deposit/withdraw functions leaving it at risk if critical actions are needed to be done.
