# `netAssetDeposits` doesn't represent the real amount of assets deposited into the Perpetual vault

## Summary
`netAssetDeposits` supposed to represent the amount of assets that are deposited to the Perpetual vault in the `PerpDepository.sol` contract, but it doesn't since there are places where the depository is depositing assets without updating the netAssetDeposits state variable.

## Vulnerability Detail
The state variable `netAssetDeposits` is being updated only on the `_depositAsset` and `_withdrawAsset` functions.
But, there are other scenarios which assets are being deposited to the Perpetual vault and the contract doesn't update the `netAssetDeposits` state variable.

Some examples:
**Deposits**
1) `_processQuoteMint` - deposits funds without increasing the `netAssetDeposits` variable.
2) `_rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap` - deposits funds without increasing the `netAssetDeposits` variable.
3) `_rebalanceNegativePnlLite` - deposits funds without increasing the `netAssetDeposits` variable.
4) `depositInsurance` - deposits funds without increasing the `netAssetDeposits` variable.
**Withdrawls**
5) `withdrawInsurance` - withdraws funds without decreasing the `netAssetDeposits` variable.
6) `_rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap` - withdraws funds without decreasing the `netAssetDeposits` variable.

## Impact
The `netAssetDeposits` variable doesn't represent the real deposited assets into the vaults.

## Recommendation
Update the `netAssetDeposits` anytime fund are being deposited / withdrawn from the vaults.
