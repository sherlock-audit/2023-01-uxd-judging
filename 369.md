# Gas grieffing at  (bool success, )

## Summary

UXDController.sol. Possibility of gas grieffing attact.

## Vulnerability Detail

 (bool success, ) is actually the same as writing (bool success, bytes memory data) which basically means that even though the data is omitted it doesnâ€™t mean that the contract does not handle it. Actually, the way it works is the bytes data that was returned from the receiver will be copied to memory. Memory allocation becomes very costly if the payload is big, so this means that if a receiver implements a fallback function that returns a huge payload, then the msg.sender of the transaction, in our case the relayer, will have to pay a huge amount of gas for copying this payload to memory.


## Impact

Users will not be able to redeem their tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use a low-level assembly call since it does not automatically copy return data to memory.

bool success;
assembly {
    success := call(3000, receiver, amount, 0, 0, 0)
}
