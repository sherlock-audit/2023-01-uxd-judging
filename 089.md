# 15 seconds is too short for TWAP price query when calculating the PNL

## Summary

15 seconds is too short for TWAP price query when calculating the PNL

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation in perp protocol integration, 

there is a function getUnrealizedPnl(), which is used to determine the PNL of the protocol

```solidity
/// @notice The unrealized Pnl from the delta neutral position.
/// @dev A positive value means the `redeemableUnderManagement` is larger than the delta neutral position
/// thus, we quote redeem or rebalance positive PnL.
/// A negative value means the `redeemableUnderManagement` is smaller than the delta neutral position value
/// thus, we can quote mint and/or rebalance negative PnL.
/// @return pnl The differnce between the `redeemableUnderManagement` and current perp position size.
function getUnrealizedPnl() public view returns (int256) {
	return int256(redeemableUnderManagement) - int256(getPositionValue());
}
```

which calls getPositionValue()

```solidity
/// @notice Returns the current size of the short position in quote amount.
/// @return Position size
function getPositionValue() public view returns (uint256) {
	uint256 markPrice = getMarkPriceTwap(15);
	int256 positionSize = IAccountBalance(clearingHouse.getAccountBalance())
		.getTakerPositionSize(address(this), market);
	return markPrice.mulWadUp(_abs(positionSize));
}
```

note the code use the 15 seconds of the TWAP price.

```solidity
uint256 markPrice = getMarkPriceTwap(15);
```

which calls:

```solidity
function getMarkPriceTwap(uint32 twapInterval)
	public
	view
	returns (uint256)
{
	IExchange exchange = IExchange(clearingHouse.getExchange());
	uint256 markPrice = exchange
		.getSqrtMarkTwapX96(market, twapInterval)
		.formatSqrtPriceX96ToPriceX96()
		.formatX96ToX10_18();
	return markPrice;
}
```

we query the price directly from the clearingHouse smart contract with Perp protocol.

However, the 15 seconds TWAP price is not the accurate representation of the market price because the last 15 seconds of the TWAP price can flucate a lot.

## Impact

the last 15 seconds of the TWAP price can flucate a lot.

This could leads to inaccurate PNL calculation and wrong rebalance of the position, which depegs the UXD token.

And the 15 minutes TWAP price is always used on perp protocol side, as seens in their documentation:

The 15 minutes TWAP price is used in funding rate calculation:

https://support.perp.com/hc/en-us/articles/5257580412569#heading-4

> This funding rate is updated every Ethereum L1 block, based on the calculation:

> ailyFundingRate = (markPriceTwap - indexPriceTwap) / indexPriceTwap

> 15-minute TWAP is used in all cases.

And the 15 minutes TWAP price is used in margin ratio calculation.

https://support.perp.com/hc/en-us/articles/5331299807513

> Liquidation is triggered when your position margin ratio is below 6.25%. Margin ratio is calculated using 15-minute TWAP of the index price.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol use 15 mintues TWAP price instead of 15 seconds TWAP price.
