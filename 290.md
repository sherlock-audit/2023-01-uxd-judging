# The `getExchangeFeeWad()` function will always return the `1e12x` times larger amount of the exchange fee than the amount of it that is supposed to be returned.

## Summary
The `getExchangeFeeWad()` function will always return the `1e12x` times larger amount of the exchange fee than the amount of it that is supposed to be returned.

## Vulnerability Detail
`HUNDRED_PERCENT` and `WAD` are defined like this:
[PerpDepository.sol#L79-L82](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L79-L82)
```solidity
    /// @dev For Perpetual protocol fee calculations
    uint256 public constant HUNDRED_PERCENT = 1e6;

    uint256 private constant WAD = 1e18;  /// @audit - 100% (10^18)
```

`getExchangeFeeWad()` function is are defined like this:
[PerpDepository.sol#L791-L797](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L791-L797)
```solidity
    /// @notice Returns the exchange fee normalized to WAD 10^18
    /// @dev 100% = 10^18
    /// @return uint256 The exchange fee normalized to a WAD.
    function getExchangeFeeWad() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 feeRatio = marketRegistry.getFeeRatio(market);
        return feeRatio.mulWadUp(WAD).divWadDown(HUNDRED_PERCENT);
    }
```

In the `getExchangeFeeWad()` function, `"the exchange fee normalized to a WAD"` is returned based on the calculation below:
[PerpDepository.sol#L796](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L796)
```solidity
feeRatio.mulWadUp(WAD).divWadDown(HUNDRED_PERCENT);
```
The exchange fee above is supposed to be calculated like `feeRatio * 18 decimals / 18 decimals` .
- However, based on the current calculation logic above, the exchange fee above is calculated `feeRatio * 18 decimals / 6 decimals` . 
- As a result, the exchange fee returned will always be `1e12x` times larger than the exchange fee that is supposed to be returned. 

## Impact
- This vulnerability cause the `getExchangeFeeWad()` function to always be returning the `1e12x` times larger amount of the exchange fee than the amount of it that is supposed to be returned.
- This lead to miscalculation in the functions for the fee calculation that the `getExchangeFeeWad()` function is internally used. (eg. `_calculatePerpOrderFeeAmount()` at the [PerpDepository.sol#L809](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L809))

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider replacing the argument value of `divWadDown()` from `HUNDRED_PERCENT` to `WAD` like this:
[PerpDepository.sol#L796](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L796)
```solidity
feeRatio.mulWadUp(WAD).divWadDown(WAD);
```

Or,

Consider replacing the assigned-value for `HUNDRED_PERCENT` from `1e6` to `1e18` like this:
[PerpDepository.sol#L80](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L80)
```solidity
    /// @dev For Perpetual protocol fee calculations
    uint256 public constant HUNDRED_PERCENT = 1e18;  /// @audit - 100% (10^18)
```
