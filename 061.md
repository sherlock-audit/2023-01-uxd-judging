# PerpDepository supposes that `clearingHouse.openPosition` returns quoteAmount in e18

## Summary
PerpDepository supposes that `clearingHouse.openPosition` returns quoteAmount in e18. But because quote token is USDC and perp uses uniswap pools internally that means that quote amount is returned in usdc decimals.
## Vulnerability Detail
When `PerpDepository.deposit` is called for WETH then `_openShort` function [will be called](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L246).

This function will create short position with clearingHouse and then increase `redeemableUnderManagement` with quote token amount.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L330-L344
```solidity
    function _openShort(uint256 amount)
        private
        returns (uint256, uint256)
    {
        (uint256 baseAmount, uint256 quoteAmount) = _placePerpOrder(
            amount,
            true, // short
            true, // exactInput
            0
        );
        redeemableUnderManagement += quoteAmount;
        _checkSoftCap();
        // emit event here
        return (baseAmount, quoteAmount);
    }
```
This quote amount is the amount of quote tokens that is received from [clearingHouse.openPosition call](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L367-L369). And exactly this amount of UXD tokens will be minted for depositor.
Because perp protocol internally uses uniswap pools, current pool that will be used is vETH/vUSDC and baseAmount is sent in e18 and quoteAmount is using e6 decimals.

From perp docs:
https://docs.perp.com/docs/guides/integration-guide/
> // quote is the amount of quote token the taker pays
// base is the amount of base token the taker gets
(uint256 base, uint256 quote) = clearingHouse.openPosition(params)

And in perp code we can see that indeed uniswap swap is done. Here [Exchange.swap is called](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-contract/blob/main/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L898-L908) when you open position, which then [calls UniswapV3Broker.swap](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-contract/blob/main/contracts/Exchange.sol#L468), which then just do simple [uniswap swap](https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-contract/blob/main/contracts/lib/UniswapV3Broker.sol#L143-L151).  

However protocol wrongly assumes that quoteAmount is scaled with e18 decimals.
You can see that in different places of contract, for example in `_processQuoteMint` function [quoteAmount is normalized to e18](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L386-L389).

As result of this, contract mints wrong amount of uxd tokens for depositing and actually all calculations with quote tokens are incorrect.

For example if user calls deposit for base token(WETH) and provides 100$ worth of WETH as deposit, then perp returns 100\*10^6 as quoteAmount and protocol mints 100\*10^6 UXD token for depositor(however wanted to mint 100\*10^18).
And when user wants to deposit 100$ quoteToken using `_processQuoteMint` it will scale it from 100\*10^6 to 100\*10^18 and will mint 100\*10^18 UXD tokens for user.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L385-L397
```solidity
    function _processQuoteMint(uint256 quoteAmount) private returns (uint256) {
        uint256 normalizedAmount = quoteAmount.fromDecimalToDecimal(
            ERC20(quoteToken).decimals(),
            18
        );
        _checkNegativePnl(normalizedAmount);
        quoteMinted += int256(normalizedAmount);
        redeemableUnderManagement += normalizedAmount;
        _checkSoftCap();
        IERC20(quoteToken).approve(address(vault), quoteAmount);
        vault.deposit(quoteToken, quoteAmount);
        return normalizedAmount;
    }
```

As result while both operation were to deposit 100$ worth of asset into PerpDepository, in 1 case user received 100\*10^6 UXD tokens and in another 100\*10^18 UXD tokens.
## Impact
Wrong token calculations.

## Recommendation
As you use USDC as quote token, that means that quoteAmount is returned scaled by e6. You need to scale it to e18 additionally to have correct calculations.
