# PerpDepository._rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap doesn't approve vault before deposit

## Summary
PerpDepository._rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap doesn't approve vault before deposit. As result tx will always revert when trying to deposit quote token.
## Vulnerability Detail
After base token is swapped to quote token inside `PerpDepository._rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap` then it should be deposited back to the perp vault to make rebalancing. 
To deposit token to the perp vault you first need to approve tokens and then call deposit.

```solidity
        IERC20(assetToken).approve(address(vault), amount);
        vault.deposit(assetToken, amount);
```
However there is [no approve before deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L524) inside `PerpDepository._rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap`. As result vault will be possible to deposit assets and function will revert.
## Impact
Rebalancing is not possible, function is not working.
