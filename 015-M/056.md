# PerpDepository: getDebtValue function uses wrong formula to calculate result

## Summary
The `PerpDepository.getDebtValue` function returns the account's debt if there is any.
In order to do this, the account value is calculated and the absolute value of it is returned if it is smaller than zero (meaning the account is in debt).

The formula used is: `quote token balance + unrealized PnL - Pending fee - pending funding payments`.

There are two issues to it.
1. `owedRealizedPnl` is not accounted for
2. Pending fee is a value that should be added, not subtracted

## Vulnerability Detail
According to the documentation (https://support.perp.com/hc/en-us/articles/5331515119001-Account-Value-More), the account value (first formula on the page) is calculated like this:
`quote token balance + owedRealizedPnl + unrealized PnL + Pending fee + pending funding payments`

This is the formula from Perpetual Protocol that is used in account value calculation: 

https://github.com/perpetual-protocol/perp-curie-contract/blob/8ad1380654ae17dd99c3bdc978e673e2590a2472/contracts/Vault.sol#L872-L874
```solidity
        settlementTokenBalanceX10_18 = getBalance(trader).parseSettlementToken(_decimals).add(
            pendingFeeX10_18.toInt256().sub(fundingPaymentX10_18).add(owedRealizedPnlX10_18)
        );
```

There you can see that `pendingFee` is added, not subtracted and the `owedRealizedPnl` value is added as well.
Your code does not even include `owedRealizedPnl`.

## Impact
The `getDebtValue` function returns an incorrect value.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement the account value computation like it is shown in the documentation.

`owedRealizedPnl` is the first return value from this function you make use of in your code (so this is how you get the `owedRealizedPnl` value):
```solidity
(
    ,
    int256 perpUnrealizedPnl,
    uint256 perpPendingFee
) = perpAccountBalance.getPnlAndPendingFee(account);
```
