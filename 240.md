# transferFrom result not checked

## Summary
Mints call `collateral.transferFrom()` but does not check results

## Vulnerability Detail
In UXDController, a user can call `mint()` to transfer in collateral and mint new redeemable tokens. A call to `collateral.transferFrom()` is made, but the results are not checked. Although Openzeppelin tokens revert on failure, some tokens do not and return a boolean value. In the interest of supporting other tokens in the future, UXD should consider checking the results from `collateral.transferFrom()`.

## Impact
Collateral may not successfully transfer, but tokens are still minted.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check to make sure the collateral is transferred
```solidity
bool transferred = collateral.transferFrom(
    account,
    depository,
    assetAmount
);
require(transferred, "Collateral transfer failed");
```
