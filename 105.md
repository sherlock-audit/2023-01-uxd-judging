# no reentrancy guard on safeTransferFrom() function that has a callback

## Summary
no reentrancy guard on safeTransferFrom() function that has a callback

## Vulnerability Detail
At https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/uniswap/Uniswapper.sol#L28
no reentrancy guard on safeTransferFrom() function that has a callback

## Impact
In Uniswapper.sol, the `safeTransferFrom()` function calls `swapExactInput` which has a callback to the "to" address argument. Functions with callbacks should have reentrancy guards in place for protection against possible malicious actors both from inside and outside the protocol.

## Code Snippet
``` solidity
        TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(params.tokenIn, msg.sender, address(this), params.amountIn);
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a reentrancy guard modifier on the `safeTransferFrom()` function in `Uniswapper.sol`
