# Initialization of Implementation contracts are missing

## Summary
There are multiple contracts that are upgradeable hence they have to have a `initialize` method in their implementation contracts which are left uninitialized.

## Vulnerability Detail
` function initialize(...) public initializer {...}`
This method is executed after proxy contracts are deployed but always in the context of the proxy contract. Hence, an attacker can call this method directly on implementation contracts (in the context of implementation contracts) if it is to their advantage. 
More details on the same can be found [here](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable#initializing_the_implementation_contract).

## Impact
This taking over of implementation contracts can affect proxy contracts directly and lead to undesired logic behavior.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L98

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/rage-trade/RageDnDepository.sol#L63

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
`/// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
constructor() {
    _disableInitializers();
}`

Add the above code snippet to all the implementation contracts (UXDController.sol, PerpDepository.sol, and RageDnDepository.sol).
This will disable the initializers when implementation contracts will be deployed.
