# UXDGovernor doesn't have transferETH function

## Summary
UXDGovernor doesn't have transferETH function. 
## Vulnerability Detail
UXDGovernor has functions that allow to provide allowance to spend some tokens on its behalf and to transfer token out of contract. These are: `approveERC20` and `transferERC20`.
But it doesn't have such function that allows to transfer native token out of contract. 
## Impact
Governance can't rescue native tokens controlled by contract.

## Recommendation
Add same `transferETH` function as in UXDTimelockController contract.
