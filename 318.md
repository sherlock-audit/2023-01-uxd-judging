# Protocol assumes UXD is pegged to USDC

## Summary
When depositing dollar-pegged stablecoins trough **Rage Trade** and **Perpetual**, the protocol mints to the user the exact amount of USDC deposited. This assumption of the deposited stablecoin price being equal to that of UXD is dangerous because, as we've seen in the past, a big depeg of the stablecoin could cause UXD to collapse.

## Vulnerability Detail
Perpetual protocol depository, when depositing, returns the same quoteAmount from the swap to mint redeemable to the user.

In the case of Rage Trade, the depository has two functions to deposit and redeem, which both return the same amount deposited (normalized to redeemable decimals).

This makes both depositories only compatible with dollar-peg stablecoins (in the case of Perpetual, the quote token should be a stablecoin while the asset token can be any).

Although the initial plans of the protocol is to use USDC, many others could be used like USDT, DAI, etc, and assuming the price of this will be equal to the price of UXD is dangerous. In the case of DAI, for instance, there are discussions to depeg the coin in the future, and this would break all depositories dependant of this stablecoin (sources https://coinmash.co/maker-dao-co-founder-believes-dai-should-drop-its-dollar-peg/, https://protos.com/explained-makerdaos-plan-to-break-the-dollar-peg/).

## Impact
High impact.

## Tool used
Manual review


## Recommendation
Use an oracle to get the relative price of UXD and the stablecoin and mint UXD accordingly.
