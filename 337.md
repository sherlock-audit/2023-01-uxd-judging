# optimism funds are at greater risk because depository has the ability to change controller address



## Summary

Depositories are the holders of user funds which are managed by the controller address in our case implemented as `UXDController` contract. 

Controller address has the ability to redeem or deposit users funds.

Currently there are implemented two depositories. But only one allows the owner to change the controller address.

UXD protocol is also a governed one. In case a proposal for changing the controller address pass trough the new address has total control for redeeming user funds. 

This method should not exists because `UXDController` is an upgradable contract and will not change its address when its logic is updated.

## Vulnerability Detail

Only `PerpDepository` is allowed to change the controller address

If the address is changed the new contract has access to all methods protected by ``onlyController`` modifier. One of which is `reedem` method

and can be used to drain funds of any holding user account on optimism chain.

## Impact

User funds on optimism chain are at risk in case this method is invoked during a governance proposal execution.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove ``setController`` method from ``PerpDepository`` contract. Don't allow controller address to be changed.

In both ``PerpDepository`` and `RageDnDepository` contracts the controller address can be made as immutable to protect the address to change in case of an upgrade trough the `initialize` method execution.
