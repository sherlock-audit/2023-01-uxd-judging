# Function `rebalance()` is vulnerable to sandwich attack

## Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L446

## Vulnerability Detail
Function `rebalance()` does a swap on a DEX (Uniswap in this case) to convert `assetToken` to `quoteToken` then deposit back to vault. 

However, anyone can call this function and specify arbitrary input params. If attacker set `amountOutMinimum = 0` and place it in the same TX with a flash loan, the chance he can extract the MEV is 100%. Also each pairs has multiple liquidity pools on Uniswap, some of them has very little liquidity which means slippage is high. In summary, attacker can
* set `amountOutMinimum = 0`
* set `swapPoolFee` to used low liquidity pool.

## Impact
Protocol is not losing anything since any slippage is coverred by `account` address. However, since this `account` is willing to compensate for the swap, I assume it belong to UXD community/team.

Consider the scenario
1. Alice approved his address to PerpDepository and send a transaction to `rebalance()`. Her swap should only lose `5%` value because she set `amountOutMinimum` to correct value.
2. Bob front-run Alice's 2nd TX and set `amountOutMinimum = 0` and also choose a low liquidity pool to extract the most value out of the swap.

## Code Snippet
Anyone can call `rebalance()` with arbitrary params
```solidity
function rebalance( // @audit anyone can call with no slippage protection ?
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 amountOutMinimum,
    uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96,
    uint24 swapPoolFee,
    int8 polarity,
    address account // @audit any account ???
) external nonReentrant returns (uint256, uint256) {
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider limiting address can call `rebalance()` or only allowing approved address to call `rebalance()` on behalf of `account` address.
