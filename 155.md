# Unused Flow

## Summary
A pathway of logic is unnecessary. Only one flow is possible. No need for check.

## Vulnerability Detail
As it stands the controller contract can only ever call `burn()` on someone else's behalf. If a future version of the controller is able to call on its own, this issue might be unwarranted. The `burn()` call is restricted to `onlyController` on the UXD Controller contract.

However, the only place it can be called is the UXD Controller contract at one location.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDController.sol#L312-L340
For the line `if (account != msg.sender)` this case always be true because `onlyController` is called first, therefor `msg.sender == controller)`

## Impact
Always perform unnecessary check (gas consumption), OR the flow is not as intended (possible vulnerability). 

## Code Snippet
See above.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
If this is the intended flow, 
```solidity
function burn(address account, uint256 amount) external onlyController {
        localMintAmount -= amount;
        _spendAllowance(account, msg.sender, amount);
        _burn(account, amount);
        emit Burned(account, amount);
    }
```
