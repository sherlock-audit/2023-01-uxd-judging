# [NAZ-M1] All `vault.withdraw()` Calls Don't Check That The Amount Is Less Than `freeCollateral`

## Summary
According to the Perpetual Protocols vault documentation one can only withdraw upto one's freeCollateral.

## Vulnerability Detail
`vault.withdraw()` is used across `PerpDepository.sol` to withdraw assets from the Perpetual Protocols vault. However, in their docs it [states](https://docs.perp.com/docs/guides/integration-guide#vaultgetfreecollateral):
> "When withdrawing collaterals, one can withdraw the amount up to one's freeCollateral. This ensures that one's positions are always sufficiently collateralized."

None of the `vault.withdraw()` calls check if the amount being withdrawn is less than `freeCollateral`. 

## Impact
This could cause unwanted behavior and even put the protocol at risk.

## Code Snippet
[`PerpDepository.sol#L219`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L219), [`PerpDepository.sol#L300`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L300), [`PerpDepository.sol#L498`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L498), [`PerpDepository.sol#L638`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L638)

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding something similar before each call of `vault.withdraw()`:
```solidity
uint256 freeCollateral = vault.getFreeCollateral(address(this));
if(amount > freeCollateral) {
    vault.withdraw(TOKEN, freeCollateral);
} else {
    vault.withdraw(TOKEN, amount);
}
```
