# Missing event for critical onlyOwner Functions

## Summary
Admin functions that change critical contract parameters/addresses/states should emit events and consider adding timelocks to allow users or other privileged roles to detect upcoming changes (by offchain monitoring of events) and react accordingly.

## Vulnerability Detail
Privileged functions in all contracts, for e.g. `PerpDepository` `onlyOwner`, have direct financial or trust impact on users who should be given an opportunity to react to them by exiting/engaging without being surprised when changes initiated by such functions are made effective opaquely (without events) and/or immediately (without timelocks).

## Impact
Protocol critical params could be changes, and users won't be aware of that and loose their money.
Also a lot of dapps use Events to track critical protocol state, they won't be able to track the critical changes without emitting these events.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add events to all possible flows (some flows emit events in callers) and consider adding timelocks to such onlyOwner functions.
