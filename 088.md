# Return value of ERC20 transfer and transferFrom is unchecked in _rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap() and _rebalanceNegativePnlLite

## Summary

In the _rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap() and  _rebalanceNegativePnlLite functions of the PerpDepository contract, the return value of `IERC20(quoteToken).transferFrom` and `IERC20(quoteToken).transfer` are not checked.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the calls to transfer and transferFrom are done and a failure occurs, no revert occurs but a result of "false" is returned. This could lead to an assumption that a transfer of the quoteToken  amount to be used in a rebalancing succeeded even if it failed.

## Impact

A `transfer` or `transferFrom` of the quoteToken during a rebalancing could fail but the _rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap() and _rebalanceNegativePnlLite functions would not revert. The amount would then get locked up in the PerpDepository contract as it does not have a function to withdraw from it. It only acts as an inbetween contract between the vault and other accounts. This will also impact maintaining the rebalancing functionality.

            );
        } else if (shortFall < 0) {
            // we got excess tokens in the spot swap. Send them to the account paying for rebalance
            IERC20(quoteToken).transfer(
                account,
                _abs(shortFall)
            );

        vault.deposit(quoteToken, amount);

        bool isShort = false;
        bool amountIsInput = true;
        (uint256 baseAmount, uint256 quoteAmount) = _placePerpOrder(
            normalizedAmount,
            isShort,
            amountIsInput,
            sqrtPriceLimitX96
        );
        vault.withdraw(assetToken, baseAmount);
        IERC20(assetToken).transfer(account, baseAmount);

        emit Rebalanced(baseAmount, quoteAmount, 0);

        return (baseAmount, quoteAmount);
```

Wrap the call into a require() or use openzeppelin's SafeERC20 library.
