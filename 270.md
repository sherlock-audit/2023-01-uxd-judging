# Malicious user can use an excessively large _toAddress in OFTCore#sendFrom to break layerZero communication

## Summary

By default layerZero implements a blocking behavior, that is, that each message must be processed and succeed in the order that it was sent. In order to circumvent this behavior the receiver must implement their own try-catch pattern. If the try-catch pattern in the receiving app ever fails then it will revert to its blocking behavior. The _toAddress input to OFTCore#sendFrom is calldata of any arbitrary length. An attacker can abuse this and submit a send request with an excessively large _toAddress to break communication between network with different gas limits.

## Vulnerability Detail

    function sendFrom(address _from, uint16 _dstChainId, bytes calldata _toAddress, uint _amount, address payable _refundAddress, address _zroPaymentAddress, bytes calldata _adapterParams) public payable virtual override {
        _send(_from, _dstChainId, _toAddress, _amount, _refundAddress, _zroPaymentAddress, _adapterParams);
    }

The _toAddress input to OFTCore#sendFrom is a bytes calldata of any arbitrary size. This can be used as follows to break communication between chains that have different block gas limits.

Example:
Let's say that an attacker wishes to permanently block the channel Arbitrum -> Optimism. Arbitrum has a massive gas block limit, much higher than Optimism's 20M block gas limit. The attacker would call sendFrom on the Arbitrum chain with the Optimism chain as the destination. For the _toAddress input they would use an absolutely massive amount of bytes. This would be packed into the payload which would be called on Optimism. Since Arbitrum has a huge gas limit the transaction would send from the Arbitrum side but it would be so big that the transaction could never succeed on the Optimism side due to gas constraints. Since that nonce can never succeed the communication channel will be permanently blocked at the Optimism endpoint, bypassing the nonblocking behavior implemented in the OFT design and reverting to the default blocking behavior of layerZero.

Users can still send messages and burn their tokens from Arbitrum -> Optimism but the messages can never be received. This could be done between any two chain in which one has a higher block gas limit. This would cause massive loss of funds and completely cripple the entire protocol.

## Impact

Massive loss of user funds and protocol completely crippled

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Limit the length of _toAddress to some amount (i.e. 256 bytes) as of right now EVM uses 20 bytes address and Sol/Aptos use 32 bytes address, so for right now it could be limited to 32 bytes.

        function sendFrom(address _from, uint16 _dstChainId, bytes calldata _toAddress, uint _amount, address payable _refundAddress, address _zroPaymentAddress, bytes calldata _adapterParams) public payable virtual override {
    +       require(_toAddress.length <= maxAddressLength);       
            _send(_from, _dstChainId, _toAddress, _amount, _refundAddress, _zroPaymentAddress, _adapterParams);
        }
