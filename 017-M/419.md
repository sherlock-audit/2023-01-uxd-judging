# Users can never redeem their USDC tokens

## Summary
User can never redeem their USDC tokens in case it's deposited into the `PerpDepository.sol`, which is the default depository.

## Vulnerability Detail
Users may want to redeem their USDC by providing their UXD tokens they got previously in the minting process.
They won't be able to redeem their USDC because the `redeem` function `PerpDepository.sol` always reverts if the `asset == quoteToken` (USDC).

Anytime a user wants to redeem this is the flow:
1) A user calls the external `redeem` function in `UXCController.sol`
2) `_redeem` internal function is triggered
3) `onlyController` protected `redeem` function in the depository contract is being called with the requested assets and amount to redeem.
4) Since the requested asset is USDC (aka `quoteToken`) the function will revert with `QuoteRedeemDisabled(msg.sender);` error

## Impact 
Users can never redeem their deposited USDC tokens.
