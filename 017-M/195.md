# Protocol can mint UXD using USDC but not redeem USDC using UXD

## Summary

Protocol allows USDC to be used to mint UXD but is unable is use UXD to redeem USDC back.

## Vulnerability Detail

In UXDController.sol, mint() is called which calls deposit() with the specific depository.

    /// @notice Mints redeemable tokens by deposirting assets
    /// @param assetToken the token being used as collateral
    /// @param assetAmount The assetAmount of `assetToken` used to mint.
    /// @return amountOut The amount of redeemable minted
    function mint(

        uint256 amountOut = IDepository(mintParams.depository).deposit(
            mintParams.assetToken, 
            mintParams.assetAmount
        );

In PerpDepository.sol, if asset is quoteToken (USDC), then _processQuoteMint is called, which calculates how much UXD can be minted from a given deposit of USDC.

    function deposit(
        address asset,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyController returns (uint256) {
        if (asset == assetToken) {
            _depositAsset(amount);
            (, uint256 quoteAmount) = _openShort(amount);
            return quoteAmount;
        } else if (asset == quoteToken) {
            return _processQuoteMint(amount);
        } else {
            revert UnsupportedAsset(asset);
        }
    }

However, when redeeming, if asset is quoteToken (USDC), a revert happens.

        } else if (asset == quoteToken) {
            revert QuoteRedeemDisabled(msg.sender);
            // return _processQuoteRedeem(amount);
        } else {

This means that USDC can be used to mint UXD but UXD cannot be redeemed back for USDC. The user that uses USDC to mint UXD will not be able to get back their UXD.

## Impact

Although it seems trivial, some users do want back their USDC for UXD in case for certain reasons. Firstly, USDC may lose or gain its peg. When such fluctuation happens, a user do not want to keep USDC for collateral. Secondly, USDC may be needed for certain projects only, so having UXD may not be important. Lastly and most importantly, if USDC cannot be redeemed, the price of UXD may decrease because of a lack of balancing between USDC and UXD. If more people holds UXD for USDC, and are unable to redeem USDC back, there will be more UXD in circulation in the market, which increases supply and thereby decreases its price. The soft cap of UXD minted will be reached really quickly and it affect the usage of the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Protocol should allow conversion of UXD back to USDC. Remove the revert statement and allow protocol to redeem USDC using UXD
