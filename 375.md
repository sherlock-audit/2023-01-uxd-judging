# Loss of funds during redeeming due to decimals rounding

## Summary
When depositing ETH to Perpetual Protocol on Optimism, transferring the minted UDX tokens to Arbitrum, and then redeeming the UDX from Rage Trade the redeemed amount is smaller than the amount that would've been received when redeemed from Perpetual Protocol. The loss may be up to 0.000001e18.
## Vulnerability Detail
Perpetual Protocol's `ClearingHouse` uses 18 decimals for base and quote amounts, which is accounted for when depositing and redeeming from Perpetual Protocol: since UXD also uses 18 decimals, there's no decimals conversion between the quote token of `ClearingHouse` and UXD (e.g. when opening a short position, [quote amount is returned as is](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L334-L343); it's then used to specify [the amount of UXD to mint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDController.sol#L245-L253)). Likewise, when redeeming from Perpetual Protocol, the amount of UXD tokens to redeem is passed as the quote amount to `ClearingHouse`â€“the amount will be sold for ETH ([PerpDepository.sol#L313-L319](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L313-L319), [UXDController.sol#L328-L336](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDController.sol#L328-L336)).

However, if UXD is redeemed from Rage Trade, the amount of UXD to redeem is truncated to 6 decimals ([RageDnDepository.sol#L128](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/rage-trade/RageDnDepository.sol#L128), [RageDnDepository.sol#L190-L193](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/rage-trade/RageDnDepository.sol#L190-L193); `assetToken` is USDC). This truncation causes a loss of funds when the UXD redeemed was minted on Optimism by depositing to Perpetual Protocol and then transferred to Arbitrum and redeemed on Rage Trade.

UXD minted via depositing to Rage Trade will always have 6 decimals, even though the token uses 18 decimals, since it's backed by USDC, which has 6 decimals. The quote token of the Perpetual Protocol vault, however, uses 18 decimals, so UXD tokens minted via depositing to Perpetual Protocol will have 18 decimals.

To demonstrate this on real numbers, at the moment of the audit shorting 1 ETH on Perpetual Protocol resulted in `1241.787882664791172014` (18 decimals) in UXD token. This exact amount can be redeemed on Perpetual Protocol, but, when redeemed on Rage Trade, it's truncated to `1241.787882` (6 decimals), even though the exact UXD amount with 18 decimals is burned.
## Impact
Users may lose up to 0.000001e18 when redeeming UXD tokens on Rage Trade.

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
When redeeming UXD, consider truncating the amount of UXD tokens to burn to the number of decimals of the underlying asset (6, in case of a Rage Trade vault with USDC; 18 in case of Perpetual Protocol). For example, if user redeems 1241.787882664791172014 UDX via Rage Trade, burn only 1241.787882 tokens.
