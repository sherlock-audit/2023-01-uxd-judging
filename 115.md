# Governance: ERC20 transfers will not work as expected

## Summary

ERC20 transfers either do not support some tokens, or will revert with the unintended errors.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let us note the current "transfer out" functions on `UXDGovernor` and `UXDTimelockController`

```solidity
function transferERC20(
      address token,
      address to,
      uint256 amount
  ) external onlyGovernance nonReentrant {
      if (!(IERC20(token).transfer(to, amount))) {
          revert GovERC20TransferFailed(token, to, amount);
      }
  }
```

```solidity
function transferERC20(address token, address to, uint256 amount) external onlySelf nonReentrant  {
      if (!(IERC20(token).transfer(to, amount))) {
          revert TimelockERC20TransferFailed(token, to, amount);
      }
  }
```

The implementation attempts to handle unsafe ERC20 `transfer` by checking its return value. However it has the following problems:
- There are tokens that they do not have a return value (don't fully conform to ERC20).
- Even if we assume governance-holding tokens are either USDC or WETH, they will revert when the transfer fails anyway, and will not reach the desired custom error.
    - It is worth noting that WETH, on failed transfers, reverts without any error messages. 

## Impact

Failed transfers will revert with unintended errors.

## Recommendation

Use OpenZeppelin's safeTransfer operations, which guarantees a standardized revert on failed transfers, and handles return values (and lack thereof) correctly.

Alternatively, the contract can check for return values in a low-level call.
