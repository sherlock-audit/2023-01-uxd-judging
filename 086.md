# Return value of ERC20 transfer is unchecked in withdrawInsurance()

## Summary

In the `withdrawInsurance()` function of the PerpDepository contract, the return value of `IERC20(insuranceToken()).transfer(to, amount);` is not checked.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the call to transfer is done, if a failure occurs, no revert occurs but a result of "false" is returned. This could lead to an assumption that a transfer of the insurance amount was withdrawn and transfered even if it failed.

## Impact

A transfer of the required insurance could fail but the `withdrawInsurance()` would not revert. This will affect insurance withdrawals.

```solidity
function withdrawInsurance(uint256 amount, address to)
        external
        nonReentrant
        onlyOwner
    {
        if (amount == 0) {
            revert ZeroAmount();
        }

        insuranceDeposited -= amount;

        vault.withdraw(insuranceToken(), amount);
        IERC20(insuranceToken()).transfer(to, amount);

        emit InsuranceWithdrawn(msg.sender, to, amount);
    }
```

## Recommendation

Wrap the call into a require() or use openzeppelin's SafeERC20 library.
