# An attacker can block the contract and cause a dos to users with usdc

## Summary
2 cases:
1.
If an attacker can get the contract to be blocked from interacting with usdc ,usdc will be stuck in the contract.
2. Attacker front runs bob's(victim)  redeem tx by blocking bob from using usdc then the usdc will be stuck in the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
ex:
Alice(Attacker) does something malicious with `address(this)` the  prep contract 
which then when a user wants to rebalance or transfer funds to insurance it will revert, making   the whole  Depository  useless
## Impact
A Malicious user can cause funds to be stuck in the contract. Since perp using usdc this can easily happen and the protocol won't work it will dos everyone and it will be very easy for users to lose funds.
## Code Snippet
The attacker does the same for the depository and nobody will be able to use usdc with minting
```solidity 
   collateral.transferFrom(
            account,
            depository,
            assetAmount
        );
```
`_redeem()`
an attacker can front-run the `intermediary` address and block it from receiving usdc.
```solidity
// _redeem() function
  IERC20(redeemParams.assetToken).transfer(redeemParams.intermediary, amountOut);
```
****
the  owner cant deposit funds to cover the  funding rate  and the fund will be liquidated
```solidity 
  IERC20(insuranceToken()).transferFrom(from, address(this), amount);
```
perp contract, users wont be able to rebalance the position
```solidity
        if (shortFall > 0) {
            IERC20(quoteToken).transferFrom(
                account,
                address(this),
                uint256(shortFall)
            );
        } else if (shortFall < 0) {
            // we got excess tokens in the spot swap. Send them to the account paying for rebalance
            IERC20(quoteToken).transfer(
                account,
                _abs(shortFall)
            );
        }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of sending tokens directly to the contract or user consider storing the number of tokens in variables and having a role or a user claim it with a different address.
Also, add an owner function to take out stuck funds
