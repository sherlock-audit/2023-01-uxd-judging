# UXDController can receive ether but there is no withdrawal functionality for excess ether

## Summary

The `UXDController` contract can receive ether but can not withdraw, ether occasionally sent by users will be stuck in those contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `UXDController` contract implements the `receive()` function. This allows the contract to receive ether when converting `wETH` back to ether. 

However, any additional ether sent by users directly to the contract will be stuck.

```solidity
receive() external payable {}

...

function redeemForEth(
    uint256 redeemAmount,
    uint256 minAmonuntOut,
    address payable receiver
) external nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
    // 1. redeem WETH to controller
    // 2. unwrap ETH
    // 3. Transfer ETH to user

    InternalRedeemParams memory rp = InternalRedeemParams({
        assetToken: weth,
        amountToRedeem: redeemAmount,
        minAmountOut: minAmonuntOut,
        intermediary: address(this)
    });

    uint256 amountOut = _redeem(rp);

    // withdraw ETH from WETH contract by burning WETH.
    // ETH is withdrawn to the caller (this contract), and can then be sent to the msg.sender
    // from this contract.
    IWETH9(weth).withdraw(amountOut);
    // solhint-disable-next-line avoid-low-level-calls
    (bool success,) = receiver.call{value: amountOut}("");
    require(success, "ETH transfer failed");

    emit Redeemed(msg.sender, receiver, amountOut);
    return amountOut;
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Only accept ether when it’s coming from the weth contract: 

```solidity
receive() external payable {
	require(msg.sender == weth, "Only weth contract can send ether");
}
```
