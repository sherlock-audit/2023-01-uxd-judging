# unsafe `approve` approach in `UXDGovernor.sol and UXDTimelockController.sol`

## Summary

`UXDGovernor.sol and UXDTimelockController.sol` both are using approve based approach to allow spender to spend token on behalf of the respective contracts.
OZ already has issued critical warning and the impact would cause. Below lines are taken from IERC20.sol


    /**
     * @dev Sets `amount` as the allowance of `spender` over the caller's tokens.
     *
     * Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.
     *
     * IMPORTANT: Beware that changing an allowance with this method brings the risk
     * that someone may use both the old and the new allowance by unfortunate
     * transaction ordering. One possible solution to mitigate this race
     * condition is to first reduce the spender's allowance to 0 and set the
     * desired value afterwards:

     *
     * Emits an {Approval} event.

## Vulnerability Detail

UXDGovernor.sol#L193-L201

    function approveERC20(
        address token,
        address spender,
        uint256 amount
    ) external onlyGovernance {
        if (!(IERC20(token).approve(spender, amount))) {
            revert GovERC20ApprovalFailed(token, spender, amount);
        }
    }

UXDTimelockController.sol#L51-L55

    function approveERC20(address token, address spender, uint256 amount) external onlySelf {
        if (!(IERC20(token).approve(spender, amount))) {
            revert TimelockERC20ApprovalFailed(token, spender, amount);
        }
    }

## Impact

It allows the user to spent more than what is desired by the protocol.

Lets say, if the UXD is allowing to spend some X amount for an user and approved the X amount of tokens.
Later, the protocol found that the X amount is pretty higher which is not needed. 
Now, if the protocol changing the allowance as Y, the user can use both X and Y amount of token.

This is loss to the protocol.

## Recommendation

Suggestion from OZ implementation,

One possible solution to mitigate this race condition is to first reduce the spender's allowance to 0 and set the desired value afterwards.
