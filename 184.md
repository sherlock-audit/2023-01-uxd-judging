# ETH may be stuck in the `UXDController.sol` contract

## Summary
ETH mistakenly sent to the `UXDController.sol` will be lost forever.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `UXDController.sol` has a fallback payable `receive()` function, and has no function to recover stuck ETH.

In case users mistakenly send ETH to the contract (Maybe they with to mint UXD tokens but don't go through the `mintWithEth` function, the ETH will be accepted by the contract due to the fallback payable `receive()` function.

This ETH will be stuck forever in the contract since there is no admin function to recover ETH from the contract.

## Impact
ETH may be stuck in the `UXDController.sol` contract forever and users may loose funds.

## Recommendation
1) Remove the fallback receive function if it's not necessary.
2) Add an admin function to recover ETH that got stuck in the contract.
