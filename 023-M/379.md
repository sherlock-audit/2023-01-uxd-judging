# Wrong `PerpVETHMarket` address on Optimism

## Summary
The deployment script for Optimism sets a wrong vETH market address when deploying `PerpDepository`, which will cause a non-functioning `PerpDepository` contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `PerpVETHMarket` contract address in the Optimism mainnet config is set to [0x36B18618c4131D8564A714fb6b4D2B1EdADc0042](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x36b18618c4131d8564a714fb6b4d2b1edadc0042#readContract), which is a Uniswap V3 pool contract, not a Perpetual Protocol market. The correct address is [0x8c835dfaa34e2ae61775e80ee29e2c724c6ae2bb](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x8c835dfaa34e2ae61775e80ee29e2c724c6ae2bb#readProxyContract).
## Impact
After deployment on the Optimism mainnet, `PerpDepository` won't be functioning due to a wrong Perpetual market address: all interactions with Perpetual Protocol will revert. A redeployment will be required since the market address [is immutable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L124).
