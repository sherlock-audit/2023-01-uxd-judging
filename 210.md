# [NAZ-M4] If Depository is Unregistered & There is Only One For A Given Market Users Can't Redeem

## Summary
Users can be blocked from redeeming if there is only one depository and it is no longer listed.

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently `UXDController.sol` implements features to add & remove depositories for a given token. If there is only one depository for a given token and users where to deposit into that depository. If it were to be removed they would no longer be able to withdraw until it is added again.

## Impact
Users will be locked out of withdrawing their assets and force them to wait for the depository is added again.

## Code Snippet
[`UXDRouter.sol#L43`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDRouter.sol#L43), [`UXDRouter.sol#L59`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/core/UXDRouter.sol#L59)

## Recommendation
