# Missing approve(0)

## Summary

Missing approve(0) may cause issues such as transaction order dependance or revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

There are 3 instances where the IERC20.approve() function is called only once without setting the allowance to zero. Some tokens, like USDT, require first reducing the address' allowance to zero by calling approve(_spender, 0). Transactions will revert when using an unsupported token like USDT.

        if (!(IERC20(token).approve(spender, amount))) {

Also, from [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc20): 

Beware that changing an allowance with this method brings the risk that someone may use both the old and the new allowance by unfortunate transaction ordering. One possible solution to mitigate this race condition is to first reduce the spenderâ€™s allowance to 0 and set the desired value afterwards.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Protocol mention that they will be using USDC for now, but it will be good if the contract is future proof as well, if they take other collateral such as USDT. 

Use approve(_spender, 0) to set the allowance to zero immediately before each of the existing approve() calls.
