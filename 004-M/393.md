# Absence of slippage leads to funds loss in case of sandwich attack

## Summary

In some cases when you open positions in ``PerpDepository`` you set all slippage parameters to ``0`` which means no slippage checks

## Vulnerability Detail

In you ``PerpDepository._placePerpOrder()`` you set ``oppositeAmountBound`` to ``0`` and comments that ``no limit, limit set by sqrtPriceLimit``
But in some cases your ``sqrtPriceLimit`` is ``0`` too:
1. ``PerpDepository._openLong()``
2. ``PerpDepository._openShort()``

## Impact

Every call to ``PerpDepository.deposit()`` and ``PerpDepository.redeem()`` leads to protocol funds loss in case of sandwich attack
Other traders can read you transactions from mempool and sell/buy before you and change price significantly. As a result, you will lose protocol money
