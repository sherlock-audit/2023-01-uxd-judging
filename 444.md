# A not so Safe Transfer() and TransferFrom() for ERC20

## Summary
Use version SafeTransfer AND TransferFrom for ERC20
## Vulnerability Detail
The transfer and transferFrom() functions doesn’t return a bool, 

## Impact
Some tokens do not implement the ERC20 standard properly but are still accepted by most code that accepts ERC20 tokens. For example correctly implement the latest EIP20 spec like Tether(USDT)‘s OR (USDC) etc transfer() and transferFrom() functions do not return booleans as the specification requires, and instead have no return value. When these sorts of tokens are cast to ERC20, their function signatures do not match and therefore the calls made, revert.

## Code Snippet
All Contract

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use OpenZeppelin’s SafeERC20’s safeTransfer()/safeTransferFrom() instead and consider safeApprove there are no more updates for the current version
