# [M-01] Loss Of UXD And UXP Tokens During Cross-Chain Bridging

## Summary

The `UXD` and `UXP` are Omnichain Fungible Tokens (OFTs), allowing users to bridge the tokens from a source chain to a destination chain through the LayerZero protocol.

I found that the bridging-related contracts used by the UXD protocol to interact with the LayerZero protocol lack proper sanitization checks on the target address (`_toAddress`), the address that is the token receiver on the destination chain.

As a result, this vulnerability can cause users to lose their `UXD` and `UXP` tokens during the cross-chain bridging processes. Moreover, this vulnerability also causes the state inconsistency issue in the `UXDToken` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The UXD protocol employs a set of bridging contracts, including `LzApp`, `NonblockingLzApp`, `OFTCore`, and `OFT`, to bridge `UXD` and `UXP` tokens from a source chain to a destination chain.

The below snippet illustrates an execution flow of bridging-related functions when a user on a source chain triggers the cross-chain token bridging process.

srcChain:

    User -> OFTCore.sendFrom(
                address _from, 
                uint16 _dstChainId, 
                bytes calldata _toAddress, 
                uint _amount, 
                address payable _refundAddress, 
                address _zroPaymentAddress, 
                bytes calldata _adapterParams
            )

         -> OFTCore._send(
                address _from, 
                uint16 _dstChainId, 
                bytes memory _toAddress, 
                uint _amount, 
                address payable _refundAddress, 
                address _zroPaymentAddress, 
                bytes memory _adapterParams
            )

         -> OFT._debitFrom(
                address _from, 
                uint16 _dstChainId, 
                bytes memory _toAddress, 
                uint _amount
            )

         -> ERC20._burn(
                address account, 
                uint256 amount
            )

         -> LzApp._lzSend(
                uint16 _dstChainId, 
                bytes memory _payload, 
                address payable _refundAddress, 
                address _zroPaymentAddress, 
                bytes memory _adapterParams, 
                uint _nativeFee
            )

         -> LzApp._lzSend() triggers the relayer (lzEndpoint) of a destination chain
```

The snippet below shows the `OFTCore.sendFrom()` function (L31 - 33). This function is the entry point invoked by a user on a source chain.

The function parameter that is the root cause of this vulnerability is **`_toAddress`**, encoded in `bytes`.

Later, the `OFTCore.sendFrom()` function will execute the internal function `OFTCore._send()` (L32). The `_send()` function (L53 - 62) encodes the `lzPayload` (L58) by executing the following statement: 

**`lzPayload = abi.encode(PT_SEND, _toAddress, amount);`**

As you can see, the `_toAddress` parameter is encoded into the `lzPayload` without validation. **If the `address(0)` encoded in `bytes` is passed to the `_toAddress` parameter, the bridging-related contracts on a source chain would not be detectable.**

Furthermore, the `_send()` function also invokes the `OFT._debitFrom(_from, _dstChainId, _toAddress, _amount)` function (L56). Finally, the `_send()` function will invoke the `LzApp._lzSend()` function (L59) to trigger the `lzEndpoint`, the relayer of a destination chain.

61:         emit SendToChain(_dstChainId, _from, _toAddress, amount);
62:     }
```

The below snippet presents the `OFT._debitFrom()` function. This function will burn the user's OFT tokens (i.e., UXD and UXP) on a source chain (L29).

29: *       _burn(_from, _amount);
30:         return _amount;
31:     }
```

After the bridging transaction on a source chain is successfully executed, the `lzEndpoint`, a bridge relayer of the destination chain, will be triggered.

The `lzEndpoint` invokes the `LzApp.lzReceive()` function to initiate the OFT token minting process on the destination chain.

The below snippet depicts an execution flow of bridging-related functions triggered by the `lzEndpoint` on the destination chain.

                        uint16 _srcChainId, 
                        bytes memory, uint64, 
                        bytes memory _payload
                    )

               -> OFT._creditTo(
                        uint16, 
                        address _toAddress, 
                        uint _amount

               -> ERC20._mint(

                        uint256 amount
                    )
```

The below snippet shows the `OFTCore._sendAck()` function, one of the bridging-related functions on the destination chain.

The `OFTCore._sendAck()` function will decode the payload previously encoded at the source chain (L65 - 67). At this point, the target address (`to`) indicating the token receiver's address is decoded (L67).

Later, the `OFT._creditTo(_srcChainId, to, amount)` function will be executed (L69).

```solidity

64:     function _sendAck(uint16 _srcChainId, bytes memory, uint64, bytes memory _payload) internal virtual {
65: *       (, bytes memory toAddressBytes, uint amount) = abi.decode(_payload, (uint16, bytes, uint));
66:
67: *       address to = toAddressBytes.toAddress(0);
68:
69: *       amount = _creditTo(_srcChainId, to, amount);
70:         emit ReceiveFromChain(_srcChainId, to, amount);
71:     }
```

The following snippet shows the `OFT._creditTo()` function. This function would invoke the `ERC20._mint(_toAddress, _amount)` function (L34) to mint the OFT tokens on the destination chain.

```solidity
SNIPPET: 6

34: *       _mint(_toAddress, _amount);
35:         return _amount;
36:     }
```

The snippet below presents the `ERC20._mint()` function. At this point, the `address(0)` would be passed to the `account` parameter, making the bridging transaction on the destination chain revert in L258.

```solidity
SNIPPET: 7

LOCATIONS: L258

257:    function _mint(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
258: *      require(account != address(0), "ERC20: mint to the zero address");
259:
260:        _beforeTokenTransfer(address(0), account, amount);
261:
262:        _totalSupply += amount;
263:        _balances[account] += amount;
264:        emit Transfer(address(0), account, amount);
265:
266:        _afterTokenTransfer(address(0), account, amount);
267:    }
```

## Impact

This vulnerability causes the OFT token minting transaction to revert on a destination chain. In other words, the token receiver would not receive any token from the bridge. Whereas the OFT tokens on a source chain would be burned, making the token sender lose their tokens permanently.

Furthermore, since the `UXP` is the UXD protocol's governance token, the loss of `UXP` tokens can also cause a negative impact on the decentralization of the protocol.

Moreover, in the case of the `UXD` token bridging, I discovered that this vulnerability also causes the state inconsistency issue in the `UXDToken` contract. Specifically, since the `UXD` tokens on a source chain would be unexpectedly burned permanently, I noticed that the state variable **`localMintAmount`** of the `UXDToken` contract would not be updated (decreasing) as expected. This could eventually affect the `UXD` token mint accounting process.

Even if the likelihood is considered LOW, nevertheless, it is possible due to several factors, such as users' mistakes, UXD protocol's front-end or back-end errors, or errors from other protocols that utilize the `UXD` and `UXP` tokens.

For the impact of this vulnerability is considered HIGH. Therefore, the risk of this vulnerability is MEDIUM.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I recommend adding a sanitization check in the `OFTCore.sendFrom()` function (the entry function on the source chain) like L32 - 33 in the snippet below.
