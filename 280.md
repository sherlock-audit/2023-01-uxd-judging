# Attackers might spam open then close position on PerpDepository to drain funds

## Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L370

## Vulnerability Detail
Perp charged taker fees when openning/closing position. However, this fee is not accounted for users when they mint UXD but for protocol itself. An attacker can spam mint/burn UXD, which is open then close position on PerpDepository to make it in loss.

## Impact
Funds deposited to Perp can be drained.

## Code Snippet
In function `_placePerpOrder()`, we can see `feeAmount` is calculated but it is not deducted to return values.
```solidity
(uint256 baseAmount, uint256 quoteAmount) = clearingHouse.openPosition(
    params
);
uint256 feeAmount = _calculatePerpOrderFeeAmount(quoteAmount);
totalFeesPaid += feeAmount;

emit PositionOpened(isShort, amount, amountIsInput, sqrtPriceLimit);
return (baseAmount, quoteAmount);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
