# The `FullMath` library is unable to handle intermediate overflows due to overflow that's desired but never reached

## Summary
The [`FullMath`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/2f3e8890ba64331be08b690018f93d3b67e82c11/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol#L10) library doesn't correctly handle the case when an intermediate value overflows 256 bits. This happens because an overflow is desired in this case but it's never reached.

## Vulnerability Detail
The [`FullMath`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/2f3e8890ba64331be08b690018f93d3b67e82c11/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol#L10) library was taken from [Uniswap v3-core](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol). However, the original solidity version that was used was < 0.8.0, meaning that the execution didn't revert wan an overflow was reached. This effectively means that when a phantom overflow (a multiplication and division where an intermediate value overflows 256 bits) occurs the execution will revert and the correct result won't be returned. The original library was designed in a way that could handle intermediate overflows.
The [`FullMath`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/2f3e8890ba64331be08b690018f93d3b67e82c11/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol#L10) library is used in the [`MathLib library`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/2f3e8890ba64331be08b690018f93d3b67e82c11/contracts/libraries/MathLib.sol#L7) in order to format an 18-decimal number to a FixedPoint 96.Q96 number.

## Impact
The correct result isn't returned in this case and the execution gets reverted when a phantom overflows occurs.

## Code Snippet
The [`FullMath`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/2f3e8890ba64331be08b690018f93d3b67e82c11/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol#L10) library which doesn't use an unchecked block:

```solidity
library FullMath {
    /// @notice Calculates floor(a×b÷denominator) with full precision. Throws if result overflows a uint256 or denominator == 0
    /// @param a The multiplicand
    /// @param b The multiplier
    /// @param denominator The divisor
    /// @return result The 256-bit result
    /// @dev Credit to Remco Bloemen under MIT license https://xn--2-umb.com/21/muldiv
    function mulDiv(
        uint256 a,
        uint256 b,
        uint256 denominator
    ) internal pure returns (uint256 result) {
        // 512-bit multiply [prod1 prod0] = a * b
        // Compute the product mod 2**256 and mod 2**256 - 1
        // then use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to reconstruct
        // the 512 bit result. The result is stored in two 256
        // variables such that product = prod1 * 2**256 + prod0
        uint256 prod0; // Least significant 256 bits of the product

        ...

      result = prod0 * inv;
        return result;
    }

    function mulDivRoundingUp(
        uint256 a,
        uint256 b,
        uint256 denominator
    ) internal pure returns (uint256 result) {
        result = mulDiv(a, b, denominator);
        if (mulmod(a, b, denominator) > 0) {
            require(result < type(uint256).max);
            result++;
        }
    }
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Code Review

## Recommendation
It is advised to put the entire function bodies of `mulDiv` and `mulDivRoundingUp` in an unchecked block. A modified version of the original `Fullmath` library that uses unchecked blocks to handle the overflow, can be found in the `0.8` branch of the [Uniswap v3-core repo](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/0.8/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol).
