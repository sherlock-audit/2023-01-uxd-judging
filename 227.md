# `redeemableUnderManagement` not normalized in all cases

## Summary

The `redeemableUnderManagement` state variable is mirroring the amount of quote managed by the contract in order to evaluate the unrealized PL of the position.

When quote is deposited, `redeemableUnderManagement` is updated with a normalized amount but when opening or closing positions, it is updated without normalization.

Here are the links to the various snippets:

In case of deposit:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L386
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L392

In case of opening
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L340
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L319

In that case `_placePerpOrder` does not normalize either so eventually the amount is added or removed without normalization. Which has an impact on the computed [unrealizedPL](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd/blob/main/contracts/integrations/perp/PerpDepository.sol#L682) and can bias the delta neutral strategy.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

Bias the delta neutral strategy which would allow to rebalance a bigger amount than the negative PL or making the rebalance function revert when trying rebalance the entire negative PL. The effect would basically depend on the difference in number of decimals of the quote token compared to 18.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use normalized amounts in `_openLong` and `_openShort` too. It's already done in the rebalance function btw.
