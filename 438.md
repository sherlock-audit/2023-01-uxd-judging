# No one will call `rebalanceLite` if the caller is unable to get more money

## Summary

No one will call `rebalanceLite` if the caller/msg.sender is unable to get more money.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `rebalanceLite()`, users will transfer `quoteToken` into it, place PerpOrder, and get `assetToken` back.

If the value of `assetToken` is not higher than the value of `quoteToken`, users will not want to call `rebalanceLite()`.

In smart contracts, itâ€™s easy for users to revert the transaction when `the value of assetToken < the value of quoteToken`. Anyone can surely get higher value / more money when calling `rebalanceLite()`, and avoid losing money.

## Impact

No one will call `rebalanceLite()` when users are unable to get more money, only the owner will call `rebalanceLite()` and pay the cost of the loss.

## Recommendation

Use a treasury account and hard-code the account address or use the modifier onlyOwner on `rebalanceLite()`.
