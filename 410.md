# Inconsistent work with ``DnGmxSeniorVault`` in ``RageDnDepository``

## Summary

Inconsistent work with ``assets/shares`` leads to users funds loss

## Vulnerability Detail

``DnGmxSeniorVault`` inherits from ``ERC4626Upgradeable``
And in ``assets/shares`` terminology users collateral token (e.g. ``USDC``) is an ``asset`` (``assertToken``), which you deposits to the ``vault``.
And some ``DnGmxSeniorVault`` ERC-20 token is a ``shares`` token

So you deposit ``asserts`` and get ``shares``
Then you withdraw ``assers`` (by ``vault.withdraw()``) and it burns your ``shares``
``Shares`` represents which part of totals vault assets is yours

But you don't event save you ``shares`` returned in ``vault.deposit()`` function call. You user ``assets`` as ``shares`` and it may lead to big problems:

1. If ``rage-trade`` protocol will add fees (it's possible because they use proxy pattern) your protocol will be broken
2. If any other not-obvious changes happen to ``rage-trade`` protocol, you protocol behaviour will be unpredictable

## Impact

Possibility of protocol DoS in case of adding fees or some unpredictable logic by ``rage-trade`` protocol

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Save ``shares`` returned from ``vault.deposit()``
2. In ``RageDnDepository. redeem()`` use ``vault.redeem()`` and user saved ``shares`` instead of using ``vault.withdraw()``
