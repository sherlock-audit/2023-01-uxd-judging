# Protocol cannot actually rebalanceNegative due to missing approval.

## Summary
The current implementation of rebalance only allows for negative rebalance. However, due to a missing approval in `_rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap()`, hence rebalancing is not possible. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract needs to give pepertual vault approval when we call `vault.deposit` since the vault uses `transferFrom` to take tokens from this contract. We can see from all other functions that approval is given before `vault.deposit`, but this is missing in `_rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap()`. As a result, rebalance will almost always revert.

```solidity
    function _rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap(
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 amountOutMinimum,
        uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96,
        uint24 swapPoolFee,
        address account
    ) private returns (uint256, uint256) {
        ...
        vault.deposit(quoteToken, quoteAmount);

        emit Rebalanced(baseAmount, quoteAmount, shortFall);
        return (baseAmount, quoteAmount);
    }
```

## Impact

Rebalancing is an important part of the protocol, in order to maintain its delta-neutral strategy. Having a malfunctioning `rebalance` function would put the protocol in an unintended risk profile.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We should add the line 

> `IERC20(quoteToken).approve(address(vault),quoteAmount);`

to grant approval before we do the vault deposit.
