# Redeem depository search does not account for amount

## Summary
```findDepositoryForRedeem``` always returns the first depository even when the amount is not sufficient.

## Vulnerability Detail
When redeeming the assets, the controller relies on the router to find the appropriate depository:
```solidity
   address depository = router.findDepositoryForRedeem(
            redeemParams.assetToken,
            redeemParams.amountToRedeem
        );
```
However, the router is too lazy and just returns the first depository for this asset:
```solidity
    function findDepositoryForRedeem(address assetToken, uint256) external view returns (address) {
        return _firstDepositoryForAsset(assetToken);
    }
```
It fails to account for the amount so technically it is possible that the returned depository does not have enough funds to cover the redemption.

## Impact
If more than one depository is registered for this asset or the order of depositories changes between deposit and redeem actions (```registerDepository```, ```unregisterDepository```), and the first depository does not have enough funds to cover the whole amount, the users will be stuck with redeemable tokens and have to wait until the router is updated.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```findDepositoryForRedeem``` should also include the amount when searching for the appropriate depository.
