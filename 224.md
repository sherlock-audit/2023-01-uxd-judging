# attacker can grief user by frontrunning rebalance with 0 amountOutMinimum and sqrtPriceLimitX96

## Summary
User who want to rebalance PerpDepository have to approve PerpDepository to spend to make up for the shortfall. However, an attacker can front run user's `rebalance` with user's supplied address and 0 amountOutMinimum and sqrtPriceLimitX96, causing user to suffer from slippage loss due to having no slippage control.

## Vulnerability Detail
`rebalance` can be called by anyone to rebalance the negative Pnl with swap of PerpDepository. The caller has to supply an account that has approved PerpDepository to spend to make up for the shortfall. 

```solidity
    function rebalance(
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 amountOutMinimum,
        uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96,
        uint24 swapPoolFee,
        int8 polarity,
        address account
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256, uint256) {
        if (polarity == -1) {
            return
                _rebalanceNegativePnlWithSwap(
                    amount,
                    amountOutMinimum,
                    sqrtPriceLimitX96,
                    swapPoolFee,
                    account
                );
        } else if (polarity == 1) {
            // disable rebalancing positive PnL
            revert PositivePnlRebalanceDisabled(msg.sender);
            // return _rebalancePositivePnlWithSwap(amount, amountOutMinimum, sqrtPriceLimitX96, swapPoolFee, account);
        } else {
            revert InvalidRebalance(polarity);
        }
    }
```

An attacker can see the tx pool for transaction of rebalance by user. Since user's supplied account have approved `PerpDepository` to spend for rebalance, the attacker can front run it by calling rebalance with the user's supplied account. He/she can set the amount to maximum of what perpDepository can rebalance with amountOutMinimum and sqrtPriceLimitX96 to 0, removing any slippage control placed by the user. As the shortfall amount is not known, user will approve a very large amount for `PerpDepository` without knowing the risk. User will suffer slippage loss while rebalancing the PnL to delta neutral position. 

Note: rebalanceLite might suffer from the same problem. However, as caller have to provide the amount to rebalance, it is most likely called by the protocol. Frontrunning can still be done by setting sqrtPriceLimitX96 to 0 and also the amount to max approval if supplied account has approved more than amount in `rebalanceLite`. Attacker can also prank `rebalanceLite` caller by setting a lower amount so that caller will always revert without rebalancing to their desired PnL position.  

## Impact

User will suffer slippage loss.

## Recommendation

Recommend using msg.sender as the account to make up for the shortfall to prevent frontrunnning attacks from occuring in between of `approve` and `rebalance`.
