# `RageDnDepository.withdrawProfits` could prevent users to redeem their `UXD` if the share price decrease in the future

## Summary

`RageDnDepository.withdrawProfits` could prevent users to redeem their `UXD` if the share price decrease in the future

## Vulnerability Detail

This issue is connected with the behavior described in the issue https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd-StErMi/issues/3

The `RageDnDepository` owner can call `withdrawProfits` that will withdraw `USDC` from the vault by burning vault shares. The amount of `USDC` withdrawn is calculated by removing the amount of `USDC` deposited by the users to the total value in `USDC` that the `RageDnDepository` owns currently 

```solidity
sharesInUSDC = vault.convertToAssets(vault.balanceOf(address(this)))
userDepositedUSDC = netAssetDeposits
pnl = sharesInUSDC - userDepositedUSDC
```

It could be that at `T0` the share value is higher and the depository can withdraw USDC by burning Rage Vault shares.
But if at `T1` the share value drops (example `1 USDC = 2 share`) users would not be able to redeem their `UXD` because the depository do not own enough shares (see the issue https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-uxd-StErMi/issues/3 for a more in-depth explanation)

## Impact

Users that have deposited `USDC` and now owns `UXD` could not be able to redeem their `UXD` to get back `USDC`

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

If this is the intended behavior, the users should be warned that even if their `1 USDC` are worth `1 UXD` it could happen that they would not be able to redeem all their `UXD` from the `Rage` depository if the Rage Vault share value decrease.

Otherwise, `UXD` should think to implement some kind of insurance to allow users to still be able to redeem all their `UXD`.
