# Upgradeable contracts lack storage gaps

## Summary

Upgradeable contracts lack storage gaps.

## Vulnerability Detail

PerpDepository.sol, RageDnDepository.sol and UXDController.sol uses OpenZeppelin Upgradeable contracts but there is no storage gap in these contracts to avoid storage clashes while using inheritance and allow a smooth upgrading process.

```solidity
import {UUPSUpgradeable} from "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol";
import {OwnableUpgradeable} from "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol";
import {AddressUpgradeable} from "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/utils/AddressUpgradeable.sol";
import {ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable} from "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/security/ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable.sol";
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider defining an appropriate storage gap in each upgradeable parent contract at the end of all the storage variable definitions as follows:

```solidity
uint256[50] __gap; // gap to reserve storage in the contract for future variable additions
```
